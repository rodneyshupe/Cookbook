### Barbecued Pork Belly

Source: [Barbecue Bible](https://barbecuebible.com/recipe/barbecued-pork-belly/)
Yield: Serves 3

#### Ingredients
* 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 pound section of pork belly
* 1	tablespoons	kosher salt
* 1	tablespoons	sugar
* 1	tablespoons	sweet paprika
* 1/2	tablespoon granulated garlic
* 1/2	tablespoon chili powder
* 1/2	tablespoon ground cumin
* 1/4	tablespoon ground black pepper
* 1/4	tablespoon mustard powder
* 1/4	teaspoon ground white pepper (or more black pepper)
* 1/4	teaspoon cayenne pepper

#### Directions
1. Remove the skin (also called rind) from the pork belly (if still on). Score
   both sides with a sharp knife, cutting a 1-inch crosshatch pattern with cuts
   1/4 inch deep.
2. Make the rub: Place the salt, sugar, paprika, garlic, chili powder, cumin,
   black pepper, mustard powder, white pepper, and cayenne in a bowl. Mix well
   with your fingers.
3. Sprinkle the rub over the top, bottom, and sides of the pork belly, rubbing
   it into the meat with your fingers.
4. Set up your smoker following the manufacturer’s instructions, and preheat
   to 225&deg;F. Add the wood as specified by the manufacturer.
5. Smoke the pork belly fat side up until bronzed with smoke and the internal
   temperature is 165&deg;F. This will take about 3 to 4 hours.
6. You can serve the pork belly hot out of the smoker, but you’ll get a better
   texture and flavor if you chill and reheat it. If using the second option,
   transfer the pork belly to a wire rack over a baking sheet and let cool to
   room temperature, then cover and refrigerate until cold. The recipe can be
   made up to 3 days ahead.
7. Cut the chilled pork belly crosswise (against the grain) into 1/2-inch thick
   slices. Lightly season each slice on both sides with salt and pepper.
8. Meanwhile, set up your grill for direct grilling and preheat to medium-high.
   Ideally, you’ll be grilling over wood or will add some wood chunks to your
   fire.
9. Arrange the pork belly strips on the grate on the diagonal and grill until
   sizzling and browned on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. (Give each
   slice a quarter turn after 1 minute to lay on a crosshatch of grill marks.)
   Don’t over-crowd your grill. The melting fat may cause flare-ups—so you
   want to leave yourself plenty of maneuvering room to dodge the flames.
