Seasoning Cast Iron
===================

Flax Seed Oil
-------------

You can find flax seed oil in the refrigerator aisle at the grocery or
health food store. Flax seed oil is the edible version of linseed oil, a
very durable, hard drying finish that painters and woodworkers have been
using for a very long time. What this translates to in practical terms
is a durable finish, after a few coats and short term heating results in
a deep glassy black seasoning on the cast iron that has held up to
months of my daily usage and cooking abuse.

Step 1: Clean the Grill/Pan
---------------------------

You will want to clean the pan to remove any rust or baked on food
residue. I used steel wool for this purpose.

Step 2: Oil the Grill/Pan
-------------------------

Pour a small amount of the flax seed oil into the pan or if doing a
grill a small ramekin. Less is more with this stuff, so no more than a
tablespoon should do for a standard pan. Then, using a paper towel or
rag, spread the oil evenly throughout all the surfaces of the grill or
pan, including the bottom, the sides, and even the handle. The grill or
pan should have a slight sheen to it, but no standing puddles of oil or
thick areas of buildup. Follow the rule of thumb for any other finish -
shoot for a nice thin even coat. You can always apply more, and, as
you’ll soon see, you will.

Step 3: Bake at 500°F for 30 Minutes
------------------------------------

Place the oiled pan inside a 500°F oven for 30 minutes. You can also use
your gas grill for this purpose. Some sources say to heat the pan for
longer, but, if you’ve put on a thin coat of oil I’ve found that 30
minutes is plenty long enough.

The pan will smoke a bit during this process. That is completely fine
and natural; your oven will not catch fire. The hot flax seed oil will
smell a bit strange, the smell will go away.

Step 4: Repeat 4 to 7 Times
---------------------------

Once you’ve “cooked” the pan for 30 minutes, remove it from the oven and
let the pan sit until it’s cool enough to touch. When you’re sure it’s
not still hot, reapply a thin coat of oil using the same method
described in step 2, put it back into the oven and cook it for another
half an hour.

Keep repeating this process until you’ve gone through as many cycles as
you’d like. I’ve found that 4 to 7 rounds was enough to result in a
semi-gloss, beautifully smooth, tough, black finish that is ready for
use.

Note
----

As with any other cast iron pan seasoning, You don’t want to use soap on
the pan when cleaning it, but with this method, I’ve found that using a
mildly abrasive sponge when doing the dishes doesn’t seem to affect the
finish at all.
