Chicken Yakiudon
================

Ingedients
----------

-  1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, patted dry with paper
   towels, trimmed, and cut into 1-inch squares
-  2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
-  1 tablespoon cornstarch
-  1 tablespoon all purpose flour
-  1/4 cup ketchup
-  1/4 cup soy sauce
-  2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
-  1 1/2 tablespoons packed brown sugar
-  3 garlic cloves, minced
-  3 anchovy fillets, rinsed, patted dry, and minced
-  1 teaspoon rice vinegar
-  1 pound fresh or 8 ounces dried udon noodles
-  2 tablespoon vegetable oil
-  6 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and sliced 1/4 inch thick
-  1 carrot, peeled and sliced 1/8 inch thick on bias
-  3/4 cup chicken broth
-  6 cups napa cabbage, sliced crosswise into 1/2-inch strips
-  7 scallions, cut on bias into 1-inch lengths

Directions
----------

1. Whisk together the sesame oil, cornstarch, and flour; set aside.
2. Whisk ketchup, soy sauce, Worcestershire, sugar, garlic, anchovies,
   and vinegar together in second bowl. Stir 2 tablespoons sauce into
   chicken in a medium bowl and set aside remaining sauce.
3. Bring 4 quarts water to boil in large pot. Add noodles and cook,
   stirring often, until almost tender (center should still be firm with
   slightly opaque dot), 3 to 10 minutes (cooking times will vary
   depending on whether you are using fresh or dry noodles). Drain
   noodles and rinse under cold running water until water runs clear.
   Drain well and set aside.
4. Heat 1/2 teaspoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat
   until just smoking. Add mushrooms and carrot and cook, stirring
   occasionally, until vegetables are spotty brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add
   1/4 cup broth and cook until all liquid has evaporated and vegetables
   are tender, about 30 seconds. Transfer vegetables to bowl.
5. Return skillet to high heat, add 1/2 teaspoon oil, and heat until
   beginning to smoke. Add cabbage and scallions and cook, without
   stirring, for 30 seconds. Cook, stirring occasionally, until cabbage
   and scallions are spotty brown and crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes.
   Transfer to bowl with mushrooms and carrot.
6. Stir the marinated chicken into the sesame oil-cornstarch mixture
   until uniformly combined. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a 12-inch nonstick
   skillet over high heat until smoking; add half of the chicken to the
   skillet in a flat, even layer. Cook, without stirring, but gently
   separating the pieces, until golden brown on the first side, about 1
   minute; turn the chicken pieces and cook until lightly browned on the
   second side, about 30 seconds. Transfer the chicken to a clean bowl.
   Repeat with an additional 2 teaspoons oil and the remaining chicken;
   cover to keep warm.
7. Return skillet to high heat; add reserved sauce, remaining 1/2 cup
   broth, and noodles. Cook, scraping up any browned bits, until noodles
   are warmed through, about 1 minute. Transfer noodles to bowl with
   vegetables and chicken and toss to combine. Season with salt to
   taste, and serve immediately.

Homemade Pizza
==============

Ingredients
-----------

**Dough** \* 1 3/4 cups water, warm (about 105°F) \* 1 envelope
rapid-rise dry yeast \* 1 tablespoon granulated sugar \* 2 tablespoons
olive oil \* 4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus extra as needed
\* 1 1/2 teaspoons table salt \* Vegetable oil (or cooking spray) for
bowl

**Sauce**

**Toppings**

Directions
----------

1. Set oven to 200°F for 10 minutes, then turn oven off.

2. Meanwhile, in bowl of food processor fitted with either metal or
   plastic blade, add water and sprinkle in yeast and sugar. Pulse twice
   to dissolve yeast. Add all remaining ingredients and process until
   mixture forms cohesive mass. Dough should not be sticky (if it is,
   add 2 more tablespoons flour and pulse briefly) nor should it be dry
   and crumbly (if it is, add 1 more tablespoons water and pulse
   briefly). Let rest for 2 minutes. Process for another 30 seconds.

3. Remove dough from food processor and knead by hand on floured work
   surface for 1 minute or until dough is smooth and satiny (dough will
   feel a bit tough at this point).

4. Very lightly oil large bowl with vegetable oil or cooking spray.
   Place dough in bowl (do not coat dough with oil) and cover with
   plastic wrap. Place in warm oven. Let rise for 40 minutes or until
   doubled. Remove from bowl, punch down, and separate into two round
   pieces. Let rest for 10 minutes under damp dish towel, then shape by
   stretching.

   -  Flatten the dough into a disk using the palm of your hand.

      -  Starting at the center and working outward, use your fingertips
         to press the disk to about 1/4-inch thick.
      -  Using one hand to hold the dough in place, use your other hand
         to stretch the dough outward. For a medium-thick pizza crust,
         repeat the stretching by turning the dough a quarter turn after
         each pull, until it is the correct diameter. For a thinner
         pizza, let the dough relax for 5 minutes, then continue
         stretching it until it has reached the correct diameter.

5. Proceed to cook topped pizza in preheated 500°F oven using the
   following guide to determine cooking time for pizza crust with
   topping but without cheese. All pizzas need to be cooked an
   additional two or three minutes after adding cheese, or until cheese
   is completely melted.

   ::

       * Thin Crust

   -  14-inch pizzas (Master Recipe makes 2) - 7 to 8 minutes
   -  12-inch pizzas (Master Recipe makes 4) - 5 minutes
   -  8-inch pizzas (Master Recipe makes 8)- 3 minutes.
   -  Medium-Thick Crust

      -  12-inch pizzas (Master Recipe makes 2) - 9 to 10 minutes
      -  8-inch pizzas (Master Recipe makes 4) - 5 minutes
      -  6-inch pizzas (Master Recipe makes 8) - 4 minutes.

   seconds, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Add carrot, celery,
   and garlic and pulse until finely chopped, 8 to 10 pulses. Add onion
   and pulse until onion is cut into 1/8- to 1/4-inch pieces, 8 to 10
   pulses. Transfer pancetta mixture to large Dutch oven. Pulse tomatoes
   in now-empty food processor until coarsely chopped, 8 to 10 pulses.

Beef Wellington
===============

Source:
`tasty.co <https://tasty.co/recipe/show-stopping-beef-wellington>`__

Yield: 12 Servings

Ingedients
----------

-  3 lb center-cut beef tenderloin
-  kosher salt, to taste
-  black pepper, to taste
-  2 tablespoons canola oil
-  1/4 cup english mustard
-  1 tablespoon butter
-  2 shallots, minced
-  2 lb cremini mushroom, minced
-  5 cloves garlic, minced
-  1/2 lb prosciutto, thinly sliced, or ham
-  1 sheet puff pastry
-  2 eggs, beaten

Directions
----------

1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Let the beef tenderloin come to room
   temperature. Season with kosher salt and pepper on all sides.
2. Add canola oil to a large pan on high heat. Once the oil is hot, add
   the tenderloin. Without moving the tenderloin, cook until a dark
   brown crust forms, about 3 minutes. Repeat searing on all sides,
   including the tenderloin ends.
3. Remove the tenderloin from the pan and transfer to a cutting board or
   wire rack and remove ties. Brush the mustard on all sides of the meat
   while it’s still warm. Let the meat rest for while making the
   duxelle.
4. To the same pan, add the butter, mushrooms, minced shallot, and
   minced garlic over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until
   all the liquid evaporates and the mushroom mixture becomes a thick,
   dry-like paste. Remove the mushrooms from the pan and let cool
   completely.
5. Place a large layer of overlapping sheets of plastic wrap on your
   work surface that is twice the length and width of the tenderloin.
   Lay overlapping strips of prosciutto on the plastic into an even
   square layer. Spread a layer of the mushrooms evenly over the
   prosciutto. Tightly and evenly wrap the tenderloin with the
   prosciutto, using the plastic wrap to wrap it even tighter and seal
   ends. Tie the ends of the plastic wrap together to hold the
   Wellington’s shape. Place in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.
6. Place a new layer of plastic wrap on the work surface and lay a sheet
   of puff pastry over it. Unwrap the prosciutto-wrapped beef tenderloin
   onto the puff pastry, wrapping until the ends meet. Cut off any extra
   puff pastry, making sure there is no overlap. Wrap the puff pastry in
   plastic wrap, tying the ends together to form a log shape. Place in
   the refrigerator for 15 minutes.
7. Place the beef Wellington on a greased, parchment paper-lined baking
   sheet. Brush the surface with the beaten eggs. With a fork, score a
   decorative design onto the surface of the puff pastry. Decorate with
   additional pastry (optional). Sprinkle with kosher salt.
8. Bake for 40 minutes or until the puff pastry is a dark golden brown
   and the internal temperature of the beef is 135°F (57°C) for
   medium-rare.

Wellington Timeline
-------------------

-  2 to 3 Days Before Serving: Dry-age the tenderloin. (This can be done
   2 days before browning or 2 to 3 days before serving, depending on
   how long you intend to chill the browned tenderloin.)
-  Up to 2 Days Before Serving:Make the stock base for the sauce.
-  Up to 1 Day Before Serving:Make the duxelles. Brown the dry-aged
   tenderloin.
-  Day of Serving: Assemble and bake the Wellington.
-  While the Wellington Roasts and Rests:Complete the sauce.

+----------+---------+--------+-----------------+
| Solution | Water   | Salt   |  Salt by Weight |
+----------+---------+--------+-----------------+
| 3.5%     | 1 Quart | 2 Tbsp |  33g            |

+----------+---------+--------+-----------------+

Notes
-----

STANDARD SOUR PICKLES (FULL-SOURS, KOSHER DILL)
A Full-Sour Pickle is one that has fully fermented and has lost its crispness and bright green color.
To ferment Full Sour Pickles, use a 5% brine.

HALF-SOUR PICKLES
A Half-Sour Pickle ferments in brine for a shorter time period and is still crisp and bright green.
For Half-Sour Pickles – eaten when they are still somewhat bright – a 3.5% brine is recommended.

FRENCH-STYLE CORNICHONS
Cornichons are about the size of your pinky finger, about an inch and half in length and less than a quarter inch in diameter. The French call them cornichons and they are sold under the same name in the US, but the English call them gherkins. Tarragon is a key ingredient in Cornichon pickles.
French-Style Cornichons Pickles use a 5% brine and are typically spiced with tarragon, garlic and peppercorns.

POLISH PICKLES
A Polish Pickle contains more spices and garlic than a traditional dill pickle. A Polish Pickle tends to be peppery and is often flavored with mustard seeds.

BREAD AND BUTTER PICKLES
A Bread and Butter Pickle is made with sliced cucumbers, spices and also sugar to give them a bit of sweetness.
https://www.fermentools.com/blog/bread-and-butter-pickle-recipe/

PICKLE RELISH
Pickle Relish is made from finely chopped pickled cucumbers and is a good way to salvage a batch of pickles that turned out too soft. Pickle Relish is typically eaten with hot dogs or hamburgers.

===================================

+-----------------------+------------------------------+--------------------------+-------------------+
| Prep Time: 15 minutes | Marinating Time: 2 - 6 hours | Cooking Time: 30 minutes | Yield: 4 servings |
+-----------------------+------------------------------+--------------------------+-------------------+

Source: `Cooks Country <https://www.cookscountry.com/recipes/9599-north-carolina-dipped-fried-chicken>`__

Ingredients
-----------

Chicken
^^^^^^^
- Salt and pepper
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 3 pounds bone-in chicken pieces (split breasts cut in half, drumsticks, thighs, and/or wings), trimmed
- 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 3/4 cup cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon granulated garlic
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 3 quarts peanut or vegetable oil

Sauce
^^^^^
- 1 1/4 cups Texas Pete Original Hot Sauce
- 5 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 5 tablespoons peanut or vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons molasses
- 1 tablespoon cider vinegar

Directions
----------
1. FOR THE CHICKEN: Dissolve 1/2 cup salt and sugar in 2 quarts cold water in
   large container. Submerge chicken in brine, cover, and refrigerate for at
   least 1 hour or up to 4 hours.
2. Whisk flour, cornstarch, granulated garlic, baking powder, 2 teaspoons
   pepper, and 1 teaspoon salt together in large bowl. Add 2 tablespoons water
   to flour mixture; using your fingers, rub flour mixture and water together
   until water is evenly incorporated and shaggy pieces of dough form.
3. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet. Working with 1 piece at a time,
   remove chicken from brine, letting excess drip off; dredge chicken in
   flour mixture, pressing to adhere. Transfer to prepared rack. Refrigerate
   chicken, uncovered, for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.
4. Set second wire rack in second rimmed baking sheet and line half of rack
   with triple layer of paper towels. Add oil to large Dutch oven until it
   measures 2 inches deep and heat over medium-high heat to 350°F. Add
   half of chicken to pot and fry until breasts register 160°F and
   drumsticks/thighs/wings register 175°F, 13 to 16 minutes. Adjust
   burner, if necessary, to maintain oil temperature between 325°F and
   350°F.
5. Transfer chicken to paper towel–lined side of prepared rack. Let chicken
   drain on each side for 30 seconds, then move to unlined side of rack.
   Return oil to 350°F and repeat with remaining chicken. Let chicken cool
   for 10 minutes.
6. FOR THE SAUCE: Meanwhile, whisk all ingredients together in bowl.
   Microwave, covered, until hot, about 2 minutes, stirring halfway through
   microwaving.
7. Dip chicken in sauce, then transfer to shallow platter. Spoon any
   remaining sauce over top. Serve.

Apple Pandowdy (Skillet Apple Pie)
==================================

Source: `Cooks Country <https://www.cookscountry.com/recipes/9129-apple-pandowdy>`__

Ingredients
-----------

Pie Dough
^^^^^^^^^
- 3 tablespoons ice water
- 1 tablespoon sour cream
- 2/3 cup (3 1/3 ounces) all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon Salt
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch pieces and frozen for 15 minutes

Filling
^^^^^^^
- 2 1/2 pounds Golden Delicious apples, peeled, cored, halved, and cut into 1/2-inch-thick wedges
- 1/4 cup packed (13/4 ounces) light brown sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon Salt
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 3/4 cup apple cider
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 2 teaspoons lemon juice

Topping
^^^^^^^
- 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten

Directions
----------
1. FOR THE PIE DOUGH: Combine ice water and sour cream in bowl. Process flour,
   sugar, and salt in food processor until combined, about 3 seconds. Add
   butter and pulse until size of large peas, 6 to 8 pulses. Add sour cream
   mixture and pulse until dough forms large clumps and no dry flour remains,
   3 to 6 pulses, scraping down sides of bowl as needed.
2. Form dough into 4-inch disk, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate
   for 1 hour. (Wrapped dough can be refrigerated for up to 2 days or frozen
   for up to 1 month. If frozen, let dough thaw completely on counter before
   rolling.)
3. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400°F. Let chilled
   dough sit on counter to soften slightly, about 5 minutes, before rolling.
   Roll dough into 10-inch circle on lightly floured counter. Using pizza
   cutter, cut dough into four 2 1/2-inch-wide strips, then make four
   2 1/2-inch-wide perpendicular cuts to form squares. (Pieces around edges
   of dough will be smaller.) Transfer dough pieces to parchment paper–lined
   baking sheet, cover with plastic, and refrigerate until firm, at least
   30 minutes.
4. FOR THE FILLING: Toss apples, sugar, cinnamon, and salt together in
   large bowl. Melt butter in 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add apple
   mixture, cover, and cook until apples become slightly pliable and release
   their juice, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
5. Whisk cider, cornstarch, and lemon juice in bowl until no lumps remain; add
   to skillet. Bring to simmer and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally,
   until sauce is thickened, about 2 minutes. Off heat, press lightly on
   apples to form even layer.
6. FOR THE TOPPING: Combine sugar and cinnamon in small bowl. Working quickly,
   shingle dough pieces over filling until mostly covered, overlapping as
   needed. Brush dough pieces with egg and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.
7. Bake until crust is slightly puffed and beginning to brown, about
   15 minutes. Remove skillet from oven. Using back of large spoon, press down
   in center of crust until juices come up over top of crust. Repeat four more
   times around skillet. Make sure all apples are submerged and return skillet
   to oven. Continue to bake until crust is golden brown, about 15 minutes
   longer.
8. Transfer skillet to wire rack and let cool for at least 20 minutes. Serve
   with ice cream, drizzling extra sauce over top.
