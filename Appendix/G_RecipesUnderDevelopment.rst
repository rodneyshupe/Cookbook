Homemade Pizza
==============

Ingredients
-----------

**Dough** \* 1 3/4 cups water, warm (about 105°F) \* 1 envelope
rapid-rise dry yeast \* 1 tablespoon granulated sugar \* 2 tablespoons
olive oil \* 4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus extra as needed
\* 1 1/2 teaspoons table salt \* Vegetable oil (or cooking spray) for
bowl

**Sauce**

**Toppings**

Directions
----------

1. Set oven to 200°F for 10 minutes, then turn oven off.

2. Meanwhile, in bowl of food processor fitted with either metal or
   plastic blade, add water and sprinkle in yeast and sugar. Pulse twice
   to dissolve yeast. Add all remaining ingredients and process until
   mixture forms cohesive mass. Dough should not be sticky (if it is,
   add 2 more tablespoons flour and pulse briefly) nor should it be dry
   and crumbly (if it is, add 1 more tablespoons water and pulse
   briefly). Let rest for 2 minutes. Process for another 30 seconds.

3. Remove dough from food processor and knead by hand on floured work
   surface for 1 minute or until dough is smooth and satiny (dough will
   feel a bit tough at this point).

4. Very lightly oil large bowl with vegetable oil or cooking spray.
   Place dough in bowl (do not coat dough with oil) and cover with
   plastic wrap. Place in warm oven. Let rise for 40 minutes or until
   doubled. Remove from bowl, punch down, and separate into two round
   pieces. Let rest for 10 minutes under damp dish towel, then shape by
   stretching.

   -  Flatten the dough into a disk using the palm of your hand.

      -  Starting at the center and working outward, use your fingertips
         to press the disk to about 1/4-inch thick.
      -  Using one hand to hold the dough in place, use your other hand
         to stretch the dough outward. For a medium-thick pizza crust,
         repeat the stretching by turning the dough a quarter turn after
         each pull, until it is the correct diameter. For a thinner
         pizza, let the dough relax for 5 minutes, then continue
         stretching it until it has reached the correct diameter.

5. Proceed to cook topped pizza in preheated 500°F oven using the
   following guide to determine cooking time for pizza crust with
   topping but without cheese. All pizzas need to be cooked an
   additional two or three minutes after adding cheese, or until cheese
   is completely melted.

   ::

       * Thin Crust

   -  14-inch pizzas (Master Recipe makes 2) - 7 to 8 minutes
   -  12-inch pizzas (Master Recipe makes 4) - 5 minutes
   -  8-inch pizzas (Master Recipe makes 8)- 3 minutes.
   -  Medium-Thick Crust

      -  12-inch pizzas (Master Recipe makes 2) - 9 to 10 minutes
      -  8-inch pizzas (Master Recipe makes 4) - 5 minutes
      -  6-inch pizzas (Master Recipe makes 8) - 4 minutes.

Beef Wellington
===============

Source:
`tasty.co <https://tasty.co/recipe/show-stopping-beef-wellington>`__

Yield: 12 Servings

Ingedients
----------

-  3 lb center-cut beef tenderloin
-  kosher salt, to taste
-  black pepper, to taste
-  2 tablespoons canola oil
-  1/4 cup english mustard
-  1 tablespoon butter
-  2 shallots, minced
-  2 lb cremini mushroom, minced
-  5 cloves garlic, minced
-  1/2 lb prosciutto, thinly sliced, or ham
-  1 sheet puff pastry
-  2 eggs, beaten

Directions
----------

1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Let the beef tenderloin come to room
   temperature. Season with kosher salt and pepper on all sides.
2. Add canola oil to a large pan on high heat. Once the oil is hot, add
   the tenderloin. Without moving the tenderloin, cook until a dark
   brown crust forms, about 3 minutes. Repeat searing on all sides,
   including the tenderloin ends.
3. Remove the tenderloin from the pan and transfer to a cutting board or
   wire rack and remove ties. Brush the mustard on all sides of the meat
   while it’s still warm. Let the meat rest for while making the
   duxelle.
4. To the same pan, add the butter, mushrooms, minced shallot, and
   minced garlic over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until
   all the liquid evaporates and the mushroom mixture becomes a thick,
   dry-like paste. Remove the mushrooms from the pan and let cool
   completely.
5. Place a large layer of overlapping sheets of plastic wrap on your
   work surface that is twice the length and width of the tenderloin.
   Lay overlapping strips of prosciutto on the plastic into an even
   square layer. Spread a layer of the mushrooms evenly over the
   prosciutto. Tightly and evenly wrap the tenderloin with the
   prosciutto, using the plastic wrap to wrap it even tighter and seal
   ends. Tie the ends of the plastic wrap together to hold the
   Wellington’s shape. Place in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.
6. Place a new layer of plastic wrap on the work surface and lay a sheet
   of puff pastry over it. Unwrap the prosciutto-wrapped beef tenderloin
   onto the puff pastry, wrapping until the ends meet. Cut off any extra
   puff pastry, making sure there is no overlap. Wrap the puff pastry in
   plastic wrap, tying the ends together to form a log shape. Place in
   the refrigerator for 15 minutes.
7. Place the beef Wellington on a greased, parchment paper-lined baking
   sheet. Brush the surface with the beaten eggs. With a fork, score a
   decorative design onto the surface of the puff pastry. Decorate with
   additional pastry (optional). Sprinkle with kosher salt.
8. Bake for 40 minutes or until the puff pastry is a dark golden brown
   and the internal temperature of the beef is 135°F (57°C) for
   medium-rare.

Wellington Timeline
-------------------

-  2 to 3 Days Before Serving: Dry-age the tenderloin. (This can be done
   2 days before browning or 2 to 3 days before serving, depending on
   how long you intend to chill the browned tenderloin.)
-  Up to 2 Days Before Serving:Make the stock base for the sauce.
-  Up to 1 Day Before Serving:Make the duxelles. Brown the dry-aged
   tenderloin.
-  Day of Serving: Assemble and bake the Wellington.
-  While the Wellington Roasts and Rests:Complete the sauce.

Brines
------

+----------+---------+--------+-----------------+
| Solution | Water   | Salt   |  Salt by Weight |
+----------+---------+--------+-----------------+
| 3.5%     | 1 Quart | 2 Tbsp |  33g            |
+----------+---------+--------+-----------------+
| 5%       | 1 Quart | 3 Tbsp |  48g            |
+----------+---------+--------+-----------------+

Notes
-----

STANDARD SOUR PICKLES (FULL-SOURS, KOSHER DILL)
A Full-Sour Pickle is one that has fully fermented and has lost its crispness and bright green color.
To ferment Full Sour Pickles, use a 5% brine.

HALF-SOUR PICKLES
A Half-Sour Pickle ferments in brine for a shorter time period and is still crisp and bright green.
For Half-Sour Pickles – eaten when they are still somewhat bright – a 3.5% brine is recommended.

FRENCH-STYLE CORNICHONS
Cornichons are about the size of your pinky finger, about an inch and half in length and less than a quarter inch in diameter. The French call them cornichons and they are sold under the same name in the US, but the English call them gherkins. Tarragon is a key ingredient in Cornichon pickles.
French-Style Cornichons Pickles use a 5% brine and are typically spiced with tarragon, garlic and peppercorns.

POLISH PICKLES
A Polish Pickle contains more spices and garlic than a traditional dill pickle. A Polish Pickle tends to be peppery and is often flavored with mustard seeds.

BREAD AND BUTTER PICKLES
A Bread and Butter Pickle is made with sliced cucumbers, spices and also sugar to give them a bit of sweetness.
https://www.fermentools.com/blog/bread-and-butter-pickle-recipe/

PICKLE RELISH
Pickle Relish is made from finely chopped pickled cucumbers and is a good way to salvage a batch of pickles that turned out too soft. Pickle Relish is typically eaten with hot dogs or hamburgers.

Apple Pandowdy (Skillet Apple Pie)
==================================

Source: `Cooks Country <https://www.cookscountry.com/recipes/9129-apple-pandowdy>`__

Ingredients
-----------

Pie Dough
^^^^^^^^^
- 3 tablespoons ice water
- 1 tablespoon sour cream
- 2/3 cup (3 1/3 ounces) all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon Salt
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch pieces and frozen for 15 minutes

Filling
^^^^^^^
- 2 1/2 pounds Golden Delicious apples, peeled, cored, halved, and cut into 1/2-inch-thick wedges
- 1/4 cup packed (13/4 ounces) light brown sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon Salt
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 3/4 cup apple cider
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 2 teaspoons lemon juice

Topping
^^^^^^^
- 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten

Directions
----------
1. FOR THE PIE DOUGH: Combine ice water and sour cream in bowl. Process flour,
   sugar, and salt in food processor until combined, about 3 seconds. Add
   butter and pulse until size of large peas, 6 to 8 pulses. Add sour cream
   mixture and pulse until dough forms large clumps and no dry flour remains,
   3 to 6 pulses, scraping down sides of bowl as needed.
2. Form dough into 4-inch disk, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate
   for 1 hour. (Wrapped dough can be refrigerated for up to 2 days or frozen
   for up to 1 month. If frozen, let dough thaw completely on counter before
   rolling.)
3. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400°F. Let chilled
   dough sit on counter to soften slightly, about 5 minutes, before rolling.
   Roll dough into 10-inch circle on lightly floured counter. Using pizza
   cutter, cut dough into four 2 1/2-inch-wide strips, then make four
   2 1/2-inch-wide perpendicular cuts to form squares. (Pieces around edges
   of dough will be smaller.) Transfer dough pieces to parchment paper–lined
   baking sheet, cover with plastic, and refrigerate until firm, at least
   30 minutes.
4. FOR THE FILLING: Toss apples, sugar, cinnamon, and salt together in
   large bowl. Melt butter in 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add apple
   mixture, cover, and cook until apples become slightly pliable and release
   their juice, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
5. Whisk cider, cornstarch, and lemon juice in bowl until no lumps remain; add
   to skillet. Bring to simmer and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally,
   until sauce is thickened, about 2 minutes. Off heat, press lightly on
   apples to form even layer.
6. FOR THE TOPPING: Combine sugar and cinnamon in small bowl. Working quickly,
   shingle dough pieces over filling until mostly covered, overlapping as
   needed. Brush dough pieces with egg and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.
7. Bake until crust is slightly puffed and beginning to brown, about
   15 minutes. Remove skillet from oven. Using back of large spoon, press down
   in center of crust until juices come up over top of crust. Repeat four more
   times around skillet. Make sure all apples are submerged and return skillet
   to oven. Continue to bake until crust is golden brown, about 15 minutes
   longer.
8. Transfer skillet to wire rack and let cool for at least 20 minutes. Serve
   with ice cream, drizzling extra sauce over top.

Chicken, Herb, and Sweet Corn Pie
=================================

+-----------------------+-----------------------------+-------------------+
| Prep Time: 15 minutes | Cooking Time: 25-45 minutes | Yield: 4 servings |
+-----------------------+-----------------------------+-------------------+

Source: `Five Dollar Foodie <http://thefivedollarfoodie.com/recipes/view/chicken-herb-and-sweet-corn-pie>`__

Ingredients
-----------

- 1/2 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, drumsticks,
  or one whole chicken breast (or pre-cooked leftover chicken pieces)
- 1/2 onions (small), diced
- 3 tablespoons oil (or butter)
- 2 1/2 tablespoons flour
- 1 cup milk
- salt and pepper to taste
- 3/4 teaspoon thyme, tarragon, or dill
- 3/4 cup corn, frozen or freshly cut off the cob (if frozen, defrosted and well-drained)
- 1 prepared pie crust, thawed according to package instructions (or homemade)
- 1 scallion, thinly sliced (optional)

Directions
----------

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. If you're using pre-cooked chicken, remove
   meat from bones, cut into bite-size pieces, set aside, and skip to step 2.
   (Refrigerate or freeze bones along with any meat clinging to them for a
   third meal of chicken soup.) If you're using fresh chicken, place the
   chicken and about a half cup of water in a tightly-lidded saucepan or
   frying pan and cook for about 8-15 minutes, depending on size of the
   chicken pieces. Test for doneness by cutting into the thickest part.
   Place chicken on a plate to cool, then remove any bones, shred the meat to
   bite-size pieces and set aside.
2. In a medium-size saucepan (you can use the same pan that you cooked the
   chicken in), sauté diced onion in oil (or butter) until softened, about
   3 minutes. Remove from heat and add flour, stirring to blend flour and oil.
   Slowly pour in the milk, while stirring—a whisk is helpful to break up any
   lumps.
3. Cook the white sauce over medium heat, stirring now and then until it
   simmers, and scraping the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking. Continue
   cooking and stirring a few more minutes until the sauce has thickened
   enough to coat a spoon. Remove from heat and stir in the seasonings:
   about 1/4 teaspoon of salt (or more to taste), along with the pepper
   and thyme, tarragon, or dill.
4. Place the chicken and corn in the white sauce, stir, and taste again for
   seasoning. Pour the creamed chicken and corn into a small baking dish. An
   8- to 10-inch cast iron skillet is perfect for this. Turn the pie crust
   upside down out of its foil plate onto the creamed chicken and pierce the
   crust a few times with a fork to allow steam to escape while baking.
   Sprinkle salt and pepper over the crust—coarsely ground salt and pepper
   from a mill are especially good—and press lightly.
5. Bake 25-30 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the sauce
   bubbles around the edges. Garnish with thyme or sliced scallion and serve
   right away, or relax first with a glass of wine and admire your handiwork.
   The cast-iron pan will keep it warm for you!

============================================

+-----------------------+--------------------------+-------------------+
| Prep Time: 15 minutes | Cooking Time: 15 minutes | Yield: 4 servings |
+-----------------------+--------------------------+-------------------+

Source: `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/4659-cod-baked-in-foil-with-leeks-and-carrots>`__

Ingredients
-----------
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 1 1/4 teaspoons finely grated zest from 1 lemon ; lemon cut into wedges
- 2 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)
- 1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves
- Salt and ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves
- 2 medium carrots, peeled and cut into matchsticks (about 1 1/2 cups)
- 2 medium leeks, white and light green parts halved lengthwise, washed, and cut into matchsticks (about 2 cups) (see note)
- 4 tablespoons vermouth or dry white wine
- 4 skinless halibut fillets, 1 to 1 1/4 inches thick (about 6 ounces each)

Directions
----------
1. Combine butter, 1/4 teaspoon zest, 1 teaspoon garlic, thyme,
   1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in small bowl. Combine parsley,
   remaining teaspoon zest, and remaining teaspoon garlic in another small
   bowl; set aside. Place carrots and leeks in medium bowl, season with salt
   and pepper, and toss together.
2. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees.
   Cut eight 12-inch sheets of foil; arrange four flat on counter. Divide
   carrot and leek mixture among foil sheets, mounding in center of each.
   Pour 1 tablespoon vermouth over each mound of vegetables. Pat fish dry
   with paper towels; season with salt and pepper and place one fillet on
   top of each vegetable mound. Spread quarter of butter mixture on top of
   each fillet. Place second square of foil on top of fish; crimp edges
   together in 1/2-inch fold, then fold over three more times to create a
   packet about 7 inches square (see illustrations, above). Place packets
   on rimmed baking sheet (overlapping slightly if necessary).
3. Bake packets 15 minutes. Open each packet promptly after baking to prevent
   overcooking. Carefully open foil, allowing steam to escape away from you.
   Using thin metal spatula, gently slide fish and vegetables onto plate with
   any accumulated juices; sprinkle with parsley mixture. Serve immediately,
   passing lemon wedges separately.

Notes
-----
Haddock, red snapper, cod, and sea bass also work well in this recipe and
those that follow as long as the fillets are 1 to 1 1/4 inches thick.

Variations
----------
Fennel and Shallots
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Replace carrots and leaks with:
  - 1 large fennel bulb (about 1 pound), trimmed, halved, cored, and sliced into 1/4-inch strips (about 4 cups)
  - 2 medium shallots, sliced thin (about 1/2 cup)
* Combine fennel and shallots in large microwave-safe bowl; cover tightly with
  plastic wrap. Microwave on high power until fennel has started to wilt,
  3 to 4 minutes, stirring once halfway through cooking.
* For the compound butter replace lemon zest and thyme with  1/4 teaspoon
  finely grated orange zest, 1 garlic clove, minced and 1 teaspoon minced
  fresh tarragon leaves.
* For topping replace  lemon zest, garlic and parsley with 2 medium oranges
  (peeled, quartered, and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick pieces) and
  1 teaspoon minced fresh tarragon leaves.

Make Ahead
----------
The packets may be assembled several hours ahead of time and refrigerated
until ready to cook. If the packets have been refrigerated for more than
30 minutes, increase the cooking time by 2 minutes.

Tacos Two Ways
==============

Ingedients
----------

Chicken
^^^^^^^

- 1/2 cup fresh navel orange juice
- 2 teaspoons fresh orange zest
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
- 1/2 teaspoons lime zest
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 3 tablespoons chopped shallot or red onion
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary (or 1 tsp dried)
- 2 teaspoons dijon mustard
- 2 teaspoons honey
- 1 1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper.
- 6 boneless skinless chicken thighs

Salsa
^^^^^
- Raw tomatillos
- avocado
- 2 serrano pepper
- garlic
- the juice of 4 limes
- bunch of coriander



Directions
----------

1. In a mixing bowl whisk together all ingredients except chicken until
   well combined.
2. Place chicken in a gallon size resealable bag or dish.  Pour marinade
   over chicken. Transfer to refrigerator and let rest at least 1 hour and
   up to 6 hours.
3. Preheat a grill over medium-high heat. Remove chicken from marinade and
   cook on grill until center registers 165 degrees in center of thickest
   portion, turning once halfway through cooking (reduce grill temperature
   as needed if chicken is browning too quickly).
4. Let chicken rest 5 minutes before serving. Chop into bite size pieces.
5. For the taco, go chicken, some thinly sliced onion, coriander and douse
   with salsa.


Mushroom/Corn/Potatoes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Potatoes (fingerling are best, small ones)
Cook the corn and then the potatoes in boiling water with salt.
Cook the mushrooms (I used oyster, it was ok - lobster are better when
they're in season) in a pan with thyme.

Mix potatoes, mushrooms and corn in a bowl with butter, mash the potatoes
a bit so the bits fit in tacos. Put a few tablespoons of the mix in the
tortillas (warmed up), somewhat try to close them (for best results,
wooden clothespins soaked in water for 30+ minutes) and grill them a few
minutes on both sides (here again, I used the broiler). Then douse with salsa.

Salsa
^^^^^
For the salsa, I did something fancy here. Morita and Cascabel peppers
(only a few) toasted with garlic, cumin seeds and sunflower seeds
(pumpkin seeds are better but couldn't find any) and tomatillos, cook
until tomatillos break apart and blend the lot with white vinegar (just
a little bit).
