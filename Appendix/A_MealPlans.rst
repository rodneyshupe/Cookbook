Directions
----------

1. Divide the ssamjang among six dipping bowls.
2. Do the same with the sesame oil, and sprinkle each bowl of oil with
   salt and pepper.
3. Put the sliced scallions and kimchi in serving bowls, and the lettuce
   in a basket draped with a damp paper towel.
4. If using, arrange mushrooms, chile, and garlic for grilling in neat
   piles on a plate. Arrange all of the ingredients on the table with
   the banchan.

Dinner
------

-  Once all the dishes are out and everyone is seated, fire up the
   tabletop grill on high. Let folks know they can snack on banchan
   while they’re waiting for the meat to cook. When the grill is hot,
   set vegetables either at the center or off to one side. Load up the
   remaining space with meat. (If you are using both marinated and
   unmarinated meat, such as marinated skirt steak and unmarinated pork
   belly, cook the unmarinated meat first so the marinade doesn’t burn
   on the grill.) Cook the meat and vegetables to your liking, or share
   cooking duties with your guests. Add more meat and vegetables to the
   grill as needed. If items are cooking too quickly, lower the heat to
   medium.
-  As the food comes off the grill, dip meat first in the sesame oil,
   then the ssamjang, then place it on a piece of lettuce leaf. Add
   grilled vegetables, sliced scallion, and kimchi to taste. Fold up the
   leaf into a little package, pop the whole thing in your mouth at
   once, and chase with soju or beer, if so inclined. If you want to
   make the meal more substantial, you can serve steamed white rice on
   the side.
