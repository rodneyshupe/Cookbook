New York Deli Cucumber Salad
============================

Yields: 4 servings

Ingredients
-----------

- 4 large English cucumbers thinly sliced
- 1 medium sweet onion sliced
- 1/4 teaspoon white pepper
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups white vinegar
- 1 cup cold water
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 2 tablespoons fresh dill minced

Directions
----------

1. Slice the cucumbers and onion and spread onto a baking tray or large
   flat surface. Sprinkle the salt and pepper all over the cucumbers and
   let them sit for 15 minutes.
2. Combine the sugar and vinegar in a sauce pot and bring to a boil. Once
   dissolved turn the heat off and add 1 cup of cold water to the pot. Let
   the mixture cool down.
3. Place the cucumbers into a flat baking dish and pour over the vinegar
   mixture and mix in the dill. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours
   but preferably overnight. At the halfway point, mix the cucumber salad
   and return to the fridge.

Notes
-----
- Seasoning the sliced cucumbers and onion before marinating is key to a
  much better flavor.  
- Avoid pouring the sugar/vinegar mix over the cucumbers when boiling hot.
  That will make the cucumbers way too soggy.
- This salad gets even better after a couple of days in the fridge.
  Leftovers can be saved for up to 5 days.
