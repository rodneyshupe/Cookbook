For a creamy and light potato salad recipe, do as the Austrians do:
Ditch the mayo and look to the soup pot. The finished salad should be
creamy and loose, with chunks of potato that keep their shape but are
very tender.

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes (about 4 large), peeled, quartered
   lengthwise, and cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices
-  1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
-  1 cup water
-  Table salt
-  1 tablespoon sugar
-  2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
-  1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
-  1/4 cup vegetable oil
-  1 small red onion, chopped fine (about 3/4 cup)
-  6 cornichons, minced (about 2 tablespoons)
-  2 tablespoons minced fresh chives
-  Ground black pepper

Directions
----------

1. Bring potatoes, broth, water, 1 teaspoon salt, sugar, and 1
   tablespoon vinegar to boil in 12-inch heavy-bottomed skillet over
   high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until potatoes
   offer no resistance when pierced with paring knife, 15 to 17 minutes.
   Remove cover, increase heat to high (so cooking liquid will reduce),
   and cook 2 minutes.
2. Drain potatoes in colander set over large bowl, reserving cooking
   liquid. Set drained potatoes aside. Pour off and discard all but 1/2
   cup cooking liquid (if 1/2 cup liquid does not remain, add water to
   make 1/2 cup). Whisk remaining tablespoon vinegar, mustard, and oil
   into cooking liquid.
3. Add 1/2 cup cooked potatoes to bowl with cooking liquid mixture and
   mash with potato masher or fork until thick sauce forms (mixture will
   be slightly chunky). Add remaining potatoes, onion, cornichons, and
   chives, folding gently with rubber spatula to combine. Season to
   taste with salt and black pepper. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Notes
-----

If you can’t find cornichons, chopped kosher dill pickles can be used in
their place.

To maintain its consistency, don’t refrigerate the salad; it should be
served within 4 hours of preparation.
