Ingredients
-----------

-  2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes (about 4 large), peeled, and cut into
   1-inch by 1-inch cubes
-  Kosher salt
-  1/4 cup mayonnaise
-  1 teaspoons dijon mustard (made with white wine)
-  1 table spoon lemon juice
-  1 jalapeno, sliced into rounds (remove seeds for less spice)
-  2 teaspoons chopped dill
-  2 teaspoons chopped parsley
-  1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions
----------

1. Cover potatoes with cold water in a large pot, season with salt, and
   bring potatoes to a boil and cook until just under fork tender
   (potatoes should still have a bite), about 25 minutes. Drain potatoes
   in a colander in the sink, and cover colander with a kitchen towel,
   until mostly cooled, about 10 minutes.
2. Toss with potatoes with mayonnaise, mustard, lemon juice, jalapeno,
   dill, parsley, and black pepper. Taste and adjust seasonings, if
   necessary, with more salt and pepper.
3. Serve at room temperature or make in advance and keep cold in the
   refrigerator.
