-----------

- 1.5kg (3 lbs) Yukon gold potatoes, cut into 1/2 inch pieces or baby potatoes
- 1/4 cup  + 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
- 3 green onions, sliced
- 1/3 cup grainy mustard

   tablespoons of apple cider vinegar over the hot potatoes and gently
   toss. Set them aside to cool completely.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar,
   grain mustard, honey and canola oil.

   toss to coat all the potatoes. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
