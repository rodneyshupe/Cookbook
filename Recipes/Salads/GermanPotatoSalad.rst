Made with creamy red or yellow potatoes, richly flavorful bacon, parsley
that's brimming with freshness, vibrant red onions and a simple, yet
perfectly tasty dressing.

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 lbs red potatoes (or Yukon gold potatoes) each about the same size for even cooking
- 6 slices bacon, (chopped)
- 2 cups chopped red onion
- 2 tsp minced garlic
- 1/2 cup chicken broth
- 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1 Tbsp dijon mustard
- 2 tsp granulated sugar
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
- 2 Tbsp olive oil

Directions
----------

1. Place red potatoes on a steamer basket* set in a pot with about 1
   1/2-inches of water. Bring water to a simmer over medium-high heat.
2. Cover pot with a snug lid and let steam until potatoes are tender, about
   20 - 25 minutes (test for doneness by piercing potatoes through center
   with a knife, it should glide through). Set aside to cool just until
   warm enough to cut into chunks.
3. While potatoes are steaming, cook bacon in a 12-inch non-stick skillet
   over medium-high heat until crisp (about 6 - 7 minutes). Remove bacon,
   set aside and leave drippings in skillet.
4. Add onions to skillet with drippings and cook 5 minutes. Add garlic and
   cook 30 seconds longer.
5. Pour in chicken broth, vinegar, dijon mustard and sugar. Bring to liquid
   to a simmer and let reduce by about half for a minute or two.
6. Add chopped potatoes, bacon and olive oil and toss. Season mixture with
   salt and pepper to taste.
7. Remove from heat, toss in parsley. Serve warm (or see notes to serve
   chilled). If mixture seems to be just slightly dry you can either toss
   in a little more olive oil or chicken broth.
