Grilled Ceaser Salad
====================

Yield: 12 Servings

Ingredients
-----------
- 3 cups cubed French bread, about 1 ½-inch cubes
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
- 2 heads (or 3 hearts) romaine lettuce, quartered through the core
- 4 lemons, halved
- 2 teaspoons anchovy paste
- 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
- 1–2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- Parmigiano Reggiano shavings
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper


Directions
----------
1. Preheat your grill or a griddle pan to medium and toss the bread into
   a bowl and set aside. In a small microwave safe dish, melt together
   the butter, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and garlic powder for 15 to 20
   seconds. Drizzle this over the bread, season with salt and pepper,
   and toss well to combine. Transfer the bread cubes onto the grill or
   griddle pan and toast, turning frequently, until the croutons are
   golden and just starting to char. Transfer them to a bowl and set aside.
2. Drizzle the remaining tablespoon of oil evenly over the quartered
   romaine heads and season with a small pinch of salt. Place the romaine
   quarters and lemon halves cut side down onto the grill and cook for
   2 minutes or so or until the greens and lemons are starting to char.
   Remove the lemons and lettuce from the heat and transfer the romaine to
   a serving platter grilled side up and set aside.
3. For the dressing, whisk the anchovy paste, mustard, and garlic together
   in the bottom of a large mixing bowl. Whisk in the red wine vinegar and
   3 to 4 tablespoons of juice from one of the lemon halves that you just
   grilled. Continue whisking and slowly drizzle in the extra virgin olive
   oil then season with salt and pepper to taste.
4. Drizzle the romaine with dressing, making sure that some of that
   yumminess gets in between the layers of leaves. Scatter the croutons
   across the top along with some Parmigiano Reggiano shavings, season
   with a bit more pepper, and arrange the grilled lemons around the
   platter for serving.
