=============================

Yield:  Serves 3-4

Ingredients
-----------
1 1/2 tablespoons lime juice, plus extra for seasoning (2 limes)
1 1/2 tablespoons sour cream
1/2 tablespoon mayonnaise
1 serrano chiles, stemmed and cut into 1/8-inch-thick rings
Salt
1 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon vegetable oil
3 ears corn, kernels cut from cobs (3 cups)
1 garlic cloves, minced
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
2 ounces cotija cheese, crumbled (1/2 cup)
1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro leaves
1 scallions, sliced thin

Directions
----------
1. Combine lime juice, sour cream, mayonnaise, serrano(s), and
   1/8 teaspoon salt in large bowl. Set aside.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat until
   shimmering. Add corn and spread into even layer. Sprinkle with
   1/4 teaspoon salt. Cover and cook, without stirring, until corn touching
   skillet is charred, about 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and let
   stand, covered, for 15 seconds, until any popping subsides. Transfer
   corn to bowl with sour cream mixture. If doubling the recipe repeat with
   1 tablespoon oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and additional corn.
3. Return now-empty skillet to medium heat and add remaining
   1/2 teaspoon oil, garlic, and chili powder. Cook, stirring constantly,
   until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer garlic mixture to bowl with
   corn mixture and toss to combine. Let cool for at least 15 minutes.
4. Add cotija, cilantro, and scallions and toss to combine. Season salad
   with salt and up to 1 tablespoon extra lime juice to taste. Serve.

Notes
-----
If desired, substitute plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream. I like serrano
chiles here, but you can substitute a jalapeno chile that has been halved
lengthwise and sliced into 1/8-inch-thick half-moons. Adjust the amount of
chiles to suit your taste. If cotija cheese is unavailable, substitute
feta cheese.
