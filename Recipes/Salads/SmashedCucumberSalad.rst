Smashed Cucumber Salad
======================

Yields: 6 servings

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 English cucumbers
- 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 2 cloves garlic, finely crushed
- 2 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar
- 1 teaspoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- red pepper flakes to taste
- 2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds

Directions
----------

1. Wrap each cucumber in plastic wrap to minimize splattering. Place on a
   work surface and pound with a flat object (like a meat pounder) until
   cucumbers crack and are slightly flattened. Remove from plastic. Cut
   cucumbers in half; halve each side lengthwise. Slice into
   1- to 1 1/2 -inch wide slices. Transfer to a strainer set over a bowl.
2. Sprinkle cucumber with salt and sugar; mix until well combined.
   Refrigerate the bowl and strainer for 30 to 60 minutes so cucumber
   pieces can drain into the bowl.
3. Place garlic, seasoned rice vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, and
   red pepper flakes in a large bowl; whisk together thoroughly.
4. Transfer drained cucumbers into the bowl with dressing. Toss to coat.
   Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate for about 30 minutes to allow
   flavors to mingle.
5. Place cucumbers in a serving bowl and sprinkle with sesame seeds.

Notes
-----
- In place of seasoned rice vinegar, you can use plain rice vinegar and
  add an extra pinch of salt and sugar to the dressing
