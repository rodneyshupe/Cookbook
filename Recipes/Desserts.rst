Bananas Foster
==============

In the 1950’s, New Orleans was the major port of entry for bananas
shipped from Central and South America. Owen edward Brennan challenged
his talented chef, Paul Blange, to include bananas in a new culinary
creation - Owen’s way of promoting the imported fruit. Simultaneously,
Holiday Magazine had asked Owen to provide a new recipe to appear in a
feature article on Brennan’s.

In 1951, Chef Paul created Bananas Foster. The scrumptious dessert was
named for Richard Foster, who, as chairman, served with Owen on the New
Orleans Crime Commission, a civic effort to clean up the French Quarter.
Richard Foster, owner of the Foster Awning Company, was a frequent
customer of Brennan’s and a very good friend of Owen.

Little did anyone realize that Bananas Foster would become an
international favorite and is the most requested item on the
restaurant’s menu. Thirty-five thousand pounds of bananas are flamed
each year at Brennan’s in the preparation of its world-famous dessert.

Ingredients
-----------

-  1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter
-  1 cup brown sugar
-  1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
-  1/4 cup banana liqueur
-  4 bananas, cut in half lengthwise, then halved
-  1/4 cup dark rum
-  4 scoops vanilla ice cream

Directions
----------

1. Combine the butter, sugar, and cinnamon in a flambe pan or skillet.
   Place the pan over low heat either on an alcohol burner or on top of
   the stove, and cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves.
2. Stir in the banana liqueur, then place the bananas in the pan. When
   the banana sections soften and begin to brown, carefully add the rum.
3. Continue to cook the sauce until the rum is hot, then tip the pan
   slightly to ignite the rum.
4. When the flames subside, lift the bananas out of the pan and place
   four pieces over each portion of ice cream. Generously spoon warm
   sauce over the top of the ice cream and serve immediately.

Variations
----------

Substitute brandy for rum (and even banana liqueur.)

This cheesecake takes at least 12 hours to make (including chilling), it is
recommend making it the day before serving.

Ingredients
-----------

Crust
^^^^^

- 6 whole graham crackers, broken into pieces
- 1/3 cup packed (2 1/3 ounces) dark brown sugar
- 1/2 cup (2 1/2 ounces) all-purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 7 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

Filling
^^^^^^^

- 2 1/2 pounds cream cheese, softened
- 1 1/2 cups (10 1/2 ounces) granulated sugar
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 1/3 cup sour cream
- 2 teaspoons lemon juice
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 6 large eggs plus 2 large egg yolks

Directions
----------

1. FOR THE CRUST: Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle
   positions and heat oven to 325 degrees. Process cracker pieces and sugar
   in food processor until finely ground, about 30 seconds. Add flour and
   salt and pulse to combine, 2 pulses. Add 6 tablespoons melted butter and
   pulse until crumbs are evenly moistened, about 10 pulses. Brush bottom
   of 9-inch springform pan with 1/2 tablespoon melted butter. Using your
   hands, press crumb mixture evenly into pan bottom. Using flat bottom of
   measuring cup or ramekin, firmly pack crust into pan. Bake on
   lower-middle rack until fragrant and beginning to brown around edges,
   about 13 minutes. Transfer to rimmed baking sheet and set aside to cool
   completely. Reduce oven temperature to 200 degrees.
2. FOR THE FILLING: Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat cream cheese,
   3/4 cup sugar, and salt at medium-low speed until combined, about
   1 minute. Beat in remaining 3/4 cup sugar until combined, about 1 minute.
   Scrape beater and bowl well; add sour cream, lemon juice, and vanilla and
   beat at low speed until combined, about 1 minute. Add egg yolks and beat
   at medium-low speed until thoroughly combined, about 1 minute. Scrape
   bowl and beater. Add whole eggs two at a time, beating until thoroughly
   combined, about 30 seconds after each addition. Pour filling through
   fine-mesh strainer set in large bowl, pressing against strainer with
   rubber spatula or back of ladle to help filling pass through strainer.

   to pop air bubbles that have risen to surface.
4. When oven thermometer reads 200 degrees, bake cheesecake on lower rack
   for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes, remove cake from oven and use toothpick
   to pierce any bubbles that have risen to surface. Return to oven and
   continue to bake until center registers 165 degrees, 2 1/4 to 2 3/4 hours
   longer. Remove cake from oven and increase oven temperature to 500 degrees.
5. When oven is at 500 degrees, bake cheesecake on upper rack until top is
   evenly browned, 4 to 12 minutes, placing rimmed baking sheet on lower rack
   to catch any drips. Let cool for 5 minutes; run paring knife between
   cheesecake and side of springform pan. Let cheesecake cool until barely
   warm, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until
   cold and firmly set, at least 6 hours. (Leftovers can be refrigerated for
   up to 4 days.)
6. To unmold cheesecake, remove sides of pan. Slide thin metal spatula
   between crust and pan bottom to loosen, then slide cheesecake onto serving
   plate. Let cheesecake stand at room temperature for about 30 minutes. To
   slice, dip sharp knife in very hot water and wipe dry between cuts. Serve

Crust
^^^^^
- 1 cup (5 ounces) all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

Filling
^^^^^^^
- 1 cup (7 ounces) granulated sugar

   2 long sheets of aluminum foil so each is 8 inches wide. Lay sheets of
   foil in pan perpendicular to each other, with extra foil hanging over
   edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing
   foil flush to pan.
2. Whisk flour, sugar, and salt together in bowl. Add melted butter and
   stir until combined. Transfer mixture to prepared pan and press into
   even layer over entire bottom of pan (do not wash bowl). Bake crust
   until dark golden brown, 19 to 24 minutes, rotating pan halfway
   through baking.

   and salt together in now-empty bowl. Whisk in eggs and yolks until no
   streaks of egg remain. Whisk in lemon zest and juice. Transfer mixture
   to saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until

   completely, at least 1½ hours. Using foil overhang, lift bars out of pan
   and transfer to cutting board. Cut into bars, wiping knife clean between
   cuts as necessary. Before serving, dust bars with confectioners' sugar,
