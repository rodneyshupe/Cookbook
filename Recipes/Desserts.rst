Bananas Foster
==============

In the 1950’s, New Orleans was the major port of entry for bananas
shipped from Central and South America. Owen edward Brennan challenged
his talented chef, Paul Blange, to include bananas in a new culinary
creation - Owen’s way of promoting the imported fruit. Simultaneously,
Holiday Magazine had asked Owen to provide a new recipe to appear in a
feature article on Brennan’s.

In 1951, Chef Paul created Bananas Foster. The scrumptious dessert was
named for Richard Foster, who, as chairman, served with Owen on the New
Orleans Crime Commission, a civic effort to clean up the French Quarter.
Richard Foster, owner of the Foster Awning Company, was a frequent
customer of Brennan’s and a very good friend of Owen.

Little did anyone realize that Bananas Foster would become an
international favorite and is the most requested item on the
restaurant’s menu. Thirty-five thousand pounds of bananas are flamed
each year at Brennan’s in the preparation of its world-famous dessert.

Ingredients
-----------

-  1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter
-  1 cup brown sugar
-  1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
-  1/4 cup banana liqueur
-  4 bananas, cut in half lengthwise, then halved
-  1/4 cup dark rum
-  4 scoops vanilla ice cream

Directions
----------

1. Combine the butter, sugar, and cinnamon in a flambe pan or skillet.
   Place the pan over low heat either on an alcohol burner or on top of
   the stove, and cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves.
2. Stir in the banana liqueur, then place the bananas in the pan. When
   the banana sections soften and begin to brown, carefully add the rum.
3. Continue to cook the sauce until the rum is hot, then tip the pan
   slightly to ignite the rum.
4. When the flames subside, lift the bananas out of the pan and place
   four pieces over each portion of ice cream. Generously spoon warm
   sauce over the top of the ice cream and serve immediately.

Variations
----------

Substitute brandy for rum (and even banana liqueur.)

Pecan Bars
==========

Source: `Cooks
Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/8571-ultranutty-pecan-bars?incode=MCSCD00L0>`__

Ingredients
-----------

Crust
^^^^^

-  1 3/4 cups (8 3/4 ounces) all-purpose flour
-  6 tablespoons (2 2/3 ounces) sugar
-  1/2 teaspoon salt
-  8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

Topping
^^^^^^^

-  3/4 cup packed (5 1/4 ounces) light brown sugar
-  1/2 cup light corn syrup
-  7 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and hot
-  1 teaspoon vanilla extract
-  1/2 teaspoon salt
-  4 cups (1 pound) pecan halves, toasted
-  1/2 teaspoon flake sea salt (optional)

Directions
----------

1. FOR THe CRUST: Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to
   350°F. Make foil sling for 13 by 9-inch baking pan by folding 2 long
   sheets of aluminum foil; first sheet should be 13 inches wide and
   second sheet should be 9 inches wide. Lay sheets of foil in pan
   perpendicular to each other, with extra foil hanging over edges of
   pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush
   to pan. Lightly spray foil with vegetable oil spray.
2. Whisk flour, sugar, and salt together in medium bowl. Add melted
   butter and stir with wooden spoon until dough begins to form. Using
   your hands, continue to combine until no dry flour remains and small
   portion of dough holds together when squeezed in palm of your hand.
   evenly scatter tablespoon-size pieces of dough over surface of pan.
   Using your fingertips and palm of your hand, press and smooth dough
   into even thickness in bottom of pan.
3. FOR THe TOPPING: Whisk sugar, corn syrup, melted butter, vanilla, and
   salt together in medium bowl until smooth (mixture will look
   separated at first but will become homogeneous), about 20 seconds.
   Fold pecans into sugar mixture until nuts are evenly coated.
4. Pour topping over crust. Using spatula, spread topping over crust,
   pushing to edges and into corners (there will be bare patches). Bake
   until topping is evenly distributed and rapidly bubbling across
   entire surface, 23 to 25 minutes.
5. Transfer pan to wire rack and lightly sprinkle with flake sea salt,
   if using. Let bars cool completely in pan on rack, about 1 1/2 hours.
   Using foil overhang, lift bars out of pan and transfer to cutting
   board. Cut into 24 bars. (Bars can be stored at room temperature for
   up to 5 days.)

Notes
-----

*It is important to use pecan halves, not pieces. The edges of the bars
will be slightly firmer than the center. If desired, trim 1/4 inch from
the edges before cutting into bars. Toast the pecans on a rimmed baking
sheet in a 350°F oven until fragrant, 8 to 12 minutes, shaking the sheet
halfway through.*
