Ingredients
-----------

- 4 russet potato, scrubbed
- 1/2 teaspoon table salt, plus extra
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, plus extra
- 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
- 1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 6 slices bacon, chopped

Directions
----------

1. MICROWAVE POTATOES Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat
   oven to 475 degrees. Set rimmed baking sheet inside oven. Prick potatoes
   all over with fork, place on paper towel, and microwave until tender, 10
   to 15 minutes, turning potatoes over after 5 minutes.
2. FRY BACON Cook bacon in large skillet over medium heat until crisp,
   about 8 minutes. Reserve 2 teaspoons bacon fat, then transfer bacon to
   paper towel-lined plate. Blot bacon with paper towels to remove excess
   grease.
3. CRISP SKINS Quarter potatoes lengthwise, let cool 5 minutes, and then
   scoop out most of flesh (reserve for another use), leaving 1/4-inch
   layer of potato flesh. Brush exterior of potatoes with reserved bacon
   fat and season with salt and pepper. Transfer potatoes, skin-side down,
   to preheated baking sheet and bake until golden brown and crisp, 15 to
   20 minutes.
4. FILL SKINS Combine cheeses, cornstarch, half of bacon, 1/2 teaspoon
   salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in bowl. Remove potato shells from oven
   and top with cheese mixture. Return to oven and bake until cheese melts,
   2 to 4 minutes. Transfer skins to paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle
   with remaining bacon. Serve.

Notes
-----

The potatoes can be cooked, scooped, and refrigerated in an airtight
container for 2 days before proceeding with the recipe. Serve with sour
cream and sliced scallions, if you like.
