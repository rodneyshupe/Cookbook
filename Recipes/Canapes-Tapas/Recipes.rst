Prosciutto-Wrapped Shrimp with Smoked Paprika
=============================================

The combination of cured pork and paprika gives these shrimp bites a
flavor reminiscent of Spanish chorizo: a little spicy and very savory.
Broil for a few minutes and the shrimp are ready to serve. They can be
completely prepped ahead of time, so they make a perfect party snack.
Serve these savory bites with a slightly sweet cocktail.

Ingredients
-----------

-  35 to 40 (6-inch) wooden skewers
-  1 tablespoon olive oil
-  2 teaspoons smoked paprika
-  1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
-  1 pound peeled and deveined shrimp (about 35 to 40 large shrimp)
   (26-30 per lb sized shrimp will also work well)
-  6 ounces very thinly sliced prosciutto or pancetta

Directions
----------

1. Place the skewers in water and let them soak for at least 30 minutes.
   Heat the broiler to high and arrange a rack at the top (about 3
   inches from the heat source).
2. Combine the oil, paprika, and pepper in a medium bowl. Add the shrimp
   and toss until evenly coated.
3. Starting at the thicker (head) end, skewer each shrimp through its
   center until the skewer emerges at the thinner (tail) end. Tearing
   the prosciutto (or pancetta) as needed, wrap each shrimp in a piece
   large enough to just cover its surface. Place on a baking sheet.
4. Broil until the shrimp are opaque and the prosciutto (or pancetta) is
   crisp, about 3 to 4 minutes.

Make-a-head
-----------

The shrimp can be made through step 3 and refrigerated uncovered for up
to 6 hours.

Variation
---------

Try the prawn or shrimp just using smoked paprika, pepper, 1/2 teaspoon
salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder. The onion powder enhances the
prawn with a dash of sweetness, but does not overdo the prawn or shrimp
in saltiness.
