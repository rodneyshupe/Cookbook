===============

Source: `Alton Brown <https://altonbrown.com/roasted-bacon-recipe/>`__

Ingredients
-----------
- 1 pound thick-cut bacon
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper (coarsely ground, separated into 1/4 measurements)
- 4 tablespoons dark muscovado sugar (plus 3 tablespoons)
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (or more if you're up to it)

Directions
----------

1. Set the oven temperature to 400 degrees F.
2. Line a half sheet pan with parchment paper and lay the bacon in a single
   layer so that thereâ€™s little or no space between the pieces on a cooling
   rack set in the pan.
3. Liberally sprinkle one side of the bacon slices with the
   1/4 teaspoon black pepper, 4 tablespoons sugar and red pepper flakes.
4. Set the sheet pan in the oven and roast for 15 minutes. Remove the pan
   and use the back of a spoon to spread the dissolved sugar/pepper mixture
   evenly across the slices of bacon. Wait one minute.
5. Flip the bacon over and liberally sprinkle the other side of the bacon
   with remaining black pepper and 3 tablespoons sugar.
6. Return the sheet pan to the oven and roast until desired doneness:
   15 minutes for chewy, 18 minutes for crisp. Cool completely before
   devouring.
