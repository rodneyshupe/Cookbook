Ingredients
-----------

- 8 large raw shell-on king prawns from sustainable sources
- 3 cloves of garlic
- 1 fresh red chilli
- a few sprigs of fresh flat-leaf parsley
- 1/2 cup olive oil ideally Spanish
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 lemon

Directions
----------

1. Peel the prawns, removing the heads and leaving the tails on. Run the
   tip of a knife down the backs of the peeled prawns and pull out and
   discard the dark vein.
2. Peel the garlic and finely chop with the chilli (deseed if you like).
   Pick and finely chop the parsley leaves.
3. Drizzle the oil into a shallow heatproof a small frying pan over a
   medium-high heat, add the garlic and chilli and fry for 30 seconds to
   flavour the oil, before stirring in the paprika.
4. Add the prawns and fry for 2 minutes on each side, or until cooked
   through, adding most of the parsley when you turn the prawns.
5. Squeeze half the lemon juice into the dish, then remove from the heat
   and sprinkle over the remaining parsley and a pinch of sea salt.
6. Serve sizzling with warm crusty bread, the remaining lemon cut wedges
   for squeezing over, and a glass of good Spanish wine.
