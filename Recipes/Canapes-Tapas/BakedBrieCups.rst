Ingredients
-----------

-  1/3 cup red currant jelly
-  2 (2.1-ounce) boxes frozen mini phyllo cups
-  1 (8-ounce) wheel firm Brie, rind trimmed, cheese cut into 1/2-inch cubes
-  1/4 cup coarsely chopped smokehouse almonds

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350°F.
2. Spoon 1/2 teaspoon jelly into each filo cup. Place 1 piece of Brie in
   each cup and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon almonds. Place phyllo cups on
   parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake until cheese is melted and jelly
   is bubbly, about 15 minutes. Cool slightly and serve warm.

Make Ahead
----------

The filled cups will keep up to 2 days in the refrigerator or 1 month in
the freezer. If frozen, defrost for 20 minutes before baking.

Filo Cups
---------

If you can not find frozen phyllo cups you can make them as follows
using 6 frozen phyllo sheets and 1/8 cup melted butter.

1. Lightly grease 24 mini muffin or tart tins; set aside.
2. Place 1 sheet of phyllo on work surface. Brush sheet lightly with
   butter. Top with second sheet; brush with butter. Top with third
   sheet; brush with butter. Cut lengthwise into 4 strips and crosswise
   into 6 strips to make 24 squares.
3. Press each square into prepared cup. Bake in centre of 400°F oven for
   about 5 minutes or until golden. Let cool in pan on rack. Repeat with
   remaining phyllo.
