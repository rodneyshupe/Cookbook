60-Minute Bread
===============

Source: The Minimalist Cooks Dinner by Mark Bittman

Ingredients
-----------

- 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed
- 2 teaspoons instant yeast, such as SAF
- 2 teaspoons salt

Directions
----------

1. Combine the flour, yeast, and salt in a bowl or food processor. Add
   1 1/4 cups warm water all at once, stirring with a wooden spoon or
   mixing with the machine on. Continue to mix, for a minute or two longer
   by hand, about 30 seconds total with the food processor. Add additional
   water by the tablespoon if necessary, until a ball forms.
2. Shape the dough into a flat round or long loaf, adding only enough flour
   to allow you to handle the dough. Place the dough on a baking sheet or a
   well-floured pizza peel. Let it rise in the warmest place in your
   kitchen, covered, while you preheat the oven to 425°F. (If you have time,
   let it rise for an hour or so.)
3. Bake the bread on a sheet, or slide it onto a baking stone. Bake until
   done, 30 to 45 minutes; the crust will be golden-brown, crisp, and firm.

-  1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
-  1/4 teaspoon baking soda
-  1 1/4 teaspoons salt
-  3 ears corn, kernels cut from cobs (2 1/4 cups) (can substitute 14oz
   can of corn niblets)

   in large bowl.
2. Process corn kernels in blender until very smooth, about 2 minutes.
   Transfer puree to medium saucepan (you should have about 1 1/2 cups).
   Cook puree over medium heat, stirring constantly, until very thick
   and deep yellow and it measures 3/4 cup, 5 to 8 minutes.
3. Remove pan from heat. Add 5 tablespoons butter and whisk until melted
   and incorporated. Add buttermilk and whisk until incorporated. Add
   eggs and yolk and whisk until incorporated. Transfer corn mixture to
   bowl with cornmeal mixture and, using rubber spatula, fold together
   until just combined.
4. Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in 10-inch cast-iron skillet over
   medium heat. Scrape batter into skillet and spread into even layer.
   Bake until top is golden brown and toothpick inserted in center comes
   out clean, 23 to 28 minutes. Let cool on wire rack for 5 minutes.
   Remove cornbread from skillet and let cool for 20 minutes before
   cutting into wedges and serving.

   for 40 minutes, taking care not to open the oven door. Remove the
   popovers to a cooling rack and pierce each one in the top with a

Almost No-Knead Sourdough Bread
===============================

Source: `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/9075-sourdough-starter>`__

Ingredients
-----------
- 3 2/3 cups (18 1/3 ounces) all-purpose flour or bread flour
- 1 3/4 teaspoons salt
- 1 1/2 cups plus 4 teaspoons (12 2/3 ounces) water, room temperature
- 1/3 cup (3 ounces) mature Sourdough Starter

Directions
----------
1. Whisk flour and salt together in medium bowl. Whisk room-temperature water
   and starter in large bowl until smooth. Add flour mixture to water mixture
   and stir using wooden spoon, scraping up dry flour from bottom of bowl
   until dough comes together, then knead by hand in bowl until shaggy ball
   forms and no dry flour remains. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sit at
   room temperature for at least 12 hours or up to 18 hours.
2. Lay 12 by 12-inch sheet of parchment paper on counter and spray generously
   with vegetable oil spray. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter and
   knead 10 to 15 times. Shape dough into ball by pulling edges into middle.
   Transfer dough, seam side down, to center of parchment. Pick up dough by
   lifting parchment edges and lower into heavy-bottomed Dutch oven. Cover
   with plastic wrap.
3. Adjust oven rack to middle position and place loaf or cake pan in bottom of
   oven. Place pot on middle rack and pour 3 cups of boiling water into pan
   below. Close oven door and let dough rise until doubled in size and does
   not readily spring back when poked with your floured finger, 2 to 3 hours.
4. Remove pot and water pan from oven; discard plastic from pot. Lightly flour
   top of dough and, using razor blade or sharp knife, make one 7-inch-long,
   1/2-inch-deep slit along top of dough. Cover pot and place on middle rack
   in oven. Heat oven to 425 degrees. Bake bread for 30 minutes (starting
   timing as soon as you turn on oven).
5. Remove lid and continue to bake until loaf is deep brown and registers
   210 degrees, 20 to 30 minutes longer. Carefully remove bread from pot;
   transfer to wire rack and let cool completely before serving.

Sourdough Starter
=================

Source: `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/9075-sourdough-starter>`__

Ingredients
-----------
- 4 1/2 cups (24 3/4 ounces) whole-wheat flour
- 5 cups (25 ounces) all-purpose flour, plus extra for maintaining starter
- Water, room temperature

Directions
----------
1. Combine whole-wheat flour and all-purpose flour in large container. Using
   wooden spoon, mix 1 cup (5 ounces) flour mixture and 2/3 cup (5 1/3 ounces)
   room-temperature water in glass bowl until no dry flour remains (reserve
   remaining flour mixture). Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room
   temperature until bubbly and fragrant, 48 to 72 hours.
2. FEED STARTER: Measure out 1/4 cup (2 ounces) starter and transfer to clean
   bowl or jar; discard remaining starter. Stir 1/2 cup (2 1/2 ounces) flour
   mixture and 1/4 cup (2 ounces) room-temperature water into starter until
   no dry flour remains. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room
   temperature for 24 hours.
3. Repeat step 2 every 24 hours until starter is pleasantly aromatic and
   doubles in size 8 to 12 hours after being fed, 10 to 14 days. At this point
   starter is mature and ready to be baked with, or it can be moved to storage.
   (If baking, use starter once it has doubled in size during 8-to-12-hour
   window. Use starter within 1 hour after it starts to deflate once reaching
   its peak.)
4. TO STORE AND MAINTAIN MATURE STARTER: Measure out 1/4 cup (2 ounces)
   starter and transfer to clean bowl; discard remaining starter. Stir
   1/2 cup (2 1/2 ounces) all-purpose flour and 1/4 cup (2 ounces)
   room-temperature water into starter until no dry flour remains. Transfer
   to clean container that can be loosely covered (plastic container or mason
   jar with its lid inverted) and let sit at room temperature for 5 hours.
   Cover and transfer to refrigerator. If not baking regularly, repeat
   process weekly.
5. TO PREPARE FOR BAKING: Eighteen to 24 hours before baking, measure out
   1/2 cup (4 ounces) starter and transfer to clean bowl; discard remaining
   starter. Stir 1 cup (5 ounces) all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup (4 ounces)
   room-temperature water into starter until no dry flour remains. Cover and
   let sit at room temperature for 5 hours. Measure out amount of starter
   called for in bread recipe and transfer to second bowl. Cover and
   refrigerate for at least 12 hours or up to 18 hours. Remaining starter
   should be refrigerated and maintained as directed.
