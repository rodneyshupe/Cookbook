Southern-Style Cornbread
========================

Ingredients
-----------
-  1 1/2 cups stone-ground cornmeal
-  1 cup all-purpose flour
-  2 tablespoons sugar
-  1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
-  1/4 teaspoon baking soda
-  1 1/4 teaspoons salt
-  3 ears corn, kernels cut from cobs (2 1/4 cups) (can substitute 14oz
   can of corn niblets)
-  6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 6 pieces
-  1 cup buttermilk (substitute 1 1/2 teaspoons of cream of tartar and 1 cup regular milk)
-  2 large eggs plus 1 large yolk


Directions
----------
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400°F. Whisk
   cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together
   in large bowl.
2. Process corn kernels in blender until very smooth, about 2 minutes.
   Transfer puree to medium saucepan (you should have about 1 1/2 cups).
   Cook puree over medium heat, stirring constantly, until very thick
   and deep yellow and it measures 3/4 cup, 5 to 8 minutes.
3. Remove pan from heat. Add 5 tablespoons butter and whisk until melted
   and incorporated. Add buttermilk and whisk until incorporated. Add
   eggs and yolk and whisk until incorporated. Transfer corn mixture to
   bowl with cornmeal mixture and, using rubber spatula, fold together
   until just combined.
4. Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in 10-inch cast-iron skillet over
   medium heat. Scrape batter into skillet and spread into even layer.
   Bake until top is golden brown and toothpick inserted in center comes
   out clean, 23 to 28 minutes. Let cool on wire rack for 5 minutes.
   Remove cornbread from skillet and let cool for 20 minutes before
   cutting into wedges and serving.

Pop Overs
=========

Ingredients
-----------
-  1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted and cooled, plus 1 teaspoon for
   the pan
-  4 3/4 ounces all-purpose flour
-  1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
-  2 large eggs, at room temperature
-  1 cup whole milk, at room temperature


Directions
----------
1. Heat the oven to 400°F.
2. Grease a 6-cup popover pan with the 1 teaspoon of butter.
3. Combine the 1 tablespoon of butter, the flour, salt, eggs and milk in
   a food processor or blender and process for 30 seconds.
4. Divide the batter evenly among the cups of the popover pan, filling
   each one-third to one-half full. Bake on the middle rack of the oven
   for 40 minutes, taking care not to open the oven door. Remove the
   popovers to a cooling rack and pierce each one in the top with a
   knife to allow steam to escape. Serve warm.

60-Minute Bread
===============

Source: The Minimalist Cooks Dinner by Mark Bittman

Ingredients
-----------

- 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed
- 2 teaspoons instant yeast, such as SAF
- 2 teaspoons salt

Directions
----------

1. Combine the flour, yeast, and salt in a bowl or food processor. Add
   1 1/4 cups warm water all at once, stirring with a wooden spoon or
   mixing with the machine on. Continue to mix, for a minute or two longer
   by hand, about 30 seconds total with the food processor. Add additional
   water by the tablespoon if necessary, until a ball forms.
2. Shape the dough into a flat round or long loaf, adding only enough flour
   to allow you to handle the dough. Place the dough on a baking sheet or a
   well-floured pizza peel. Let it rise in the warmest place in your
   kitchen, covered, while you preheat the oven to 425°F. (If you have time,
   let it rise for an hour or so.)
3. Bake the bread on a sheet, or slide it onto a baking stone. Bake until
   done, 30 to 45 minutes; the crust will be golden-brown, crisp, and firm.

Easy No-Knead Focaccia
======================

Source: `Bon Appetit <https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/easy-no-knead-focaccia>`__

Ingredients
-----------
- 1 1/4-oz. (8g) envelope active dry yeast (about 2 1/4 tsp.)
- 2 tsp. honey
- 5 cups (625 g) all-purpose flour
- 5 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 Tbsp. Morton kosher salt
- 6 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more for hands
- 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, plus more for pan
- Flaky sea salt
- 2 garlic cloves

Directions
----------
1. Whisk one envelope active dry yeast, honey, and 2 1/2 cups lukewarm water
   in a medium bowl and let sit 5 minutes (it should foam or at least get
   creamy; if it doesn’t your yeast is dead and you should start again—check
   the expiration date!).
2. Add 5 cups (625 g) all-purpose flour and salt and mix with a rubber
   spatula until a shaggy dough forms and no dry streaks remain.
3. Pour 4 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil into a big bowl that will fit in your
   refrigerator. This puppy is going to rise! Transfer dough to bowl and
   turn to coat in oil. Cover with a silicone lid or plastic wrap and chill
   until dough is doubled in size (it should look very bubbly and alive), at
   least 8 hours and up to 1 day. If you're in a rush, you can also let it
   rise at room temperature until doubled in size, 3–4 hours.
4. Generously butter a 13x9" baking pan, for thicker focaccia that’s perfect
   for sandwiches, or an 18x13" rimmed baking sheet, for focaccia that's
   thinner, crispier, and great for snacking. The butter may seem
   superfluous, but it’ll ensure that your focaccia doesn’t stick. Pour
   1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil into center of pan. Keeping the dough in
   the bowl and using a fork in each hand, gather up edges of dough farthest
   from you and lift up and over into center of bowl. Give the bowl a
   quarter turn and repeat process. Do this 2 more times; you want to
   deflate dough while you form it into a rough ball. (We learned this
   technique from Alexandra Stafford, who uses it to shape her no-knead
   bread.) Transfer dough to prepared pan. Pour any oil left in bowl over
   and turn dough to coat it in oil. Let rise, uncovered, in a dry, warm
   spot (like near a radiator or on top of the fridge or a preheating oven)
   until doubled in size, at least 1 1/2 hours and up to 4 hours.
5. Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 450°. To see if the dough is
   ready, poke it with your finger. It should spring back slowly, leaving a
   small visible indentation. If it springs back quickly, the dough isn’t
   ready. (If at this point the dough is ready to bake but you aren’t, you
   can chill it up to 1 hour.) Lightly oil your hands. If using a rimmed
   baking sheet, gently stretch out dough to fill (you probably won't need
   to do this if using a baking pan). Dimple focaccia all over with your
   fingers, like you’re aggressively playing the piano, creating very deep
   depressions in the dough (reach your fingers all the way to the bottom
   of the pan). Drizzle with remaining 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil and
   sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Bake focaccia until puffed and golden
   brown all over, 20–30 minutes.
6. Hold off on this last step until you're ready to serve the focaccia:
   Melt 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.
   Remove from heat. Peel and grate in garlic cloves with a Microplane.
   Return to medium heat and cook, stirring often, until garlic is just
   lightly toasted, 30–45 seconds. (Or, if you prefer raw garlic to
   toasted garlic, you can grate the garlic into the hot butter, off
   heat, then brush right away.)
7. Brush garlic-butter all over focaccia and slice into squares or
   rectangles.

Note
----
Make Ahead: Focaccia is best eaten the day it's made, but keeps well in the
freezer. Slice it into pieces, store it in a freezer-safe container, then
reheat it on a baking sheet in a 300° F oven.

No-Knead Bread
==============

Source: `NY Times <https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11376-no-knead-bread>`__

Ingredients
-----------
- 430 grams flour
- 1 gram yeast
- 8-12 grams salt (I use 10 grams)
- 345 grams water

Directions
----------
1. In a large bowl combine flour, yeast and salt. Add water, and stir until
   blended; dough will be shaggy and sticky. Cover bowl with plastic wrap.
   Let dough rest at least 12 hours, preferably about 18, at warm room
   temperature, about 70 degrees.
2. Dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles. Lightly flour a
   work surface and place dough on it; sprinkle it with a little more flour
   and fold it over on itself once or twice. Cover loosely with plastic
   wrap and let rest about 15 minutes.
3. Using just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to work surface or
   to your fingers, gently and quickly shape dough into a ball. Generously
   coat a cotton towel (not terry cloth) with flour, wheat bran or cornmeal;
   put dough seam side down on towel and dust with more flour, bran or
   cornmeal. Cover with another cotton towel and let rise for about 2 hours.
   When it is ready, dough will be more than double in size and will not
   readily spring back when poked with a finger.
4. At least a half-hour before dough is ready, heat oven to 450 degrees. Put
   a 6- to 8-quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex or ceramic)
   in oven as it heats. When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven.
   Slide your hand under towel and turn dough over into pot, seam side up;
   it may look like a mess, but that is O.K. Shake pan once or twice if
   dough is unevenly distributed; it will straighten out as it bakes. Cover
   with lid and bake 30 minutes, then remove lid and bake another
   15 to 30 minutes, until loaf is beautifully browned. Cool on a rack.

Variation
---------
Use 400 grams flour and 300 grams water
Add 8g yeast and 1 tsp honey for quicker loaf.

- 425g flour (or 285 white and 140g whole wheat and add tbsp honey)
- 1 gram (1/4 teaspoon) yeast
- 8-12 grams salt (I use 10 grams)
- 15g (1 tbsp) distilled white vinegar
- 200g water
- 90g beer

1 teaspoon dry Mustard
1 table sponnes hotsauce
2 tablespoons butter move_completed
1 sleave saltines

Almost No-Knead Sourdough Bread
===============================

Source: `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/9075-sourdough-starter>`__

Ingredients
-----------
- 3 2/3 cups (18 1/3 ounces) all-purpose flour or bread flour
- 1 3/4 teaspoons salt
- 1 1/2 cups plus 4 teaspoons (12 2/3 ounces) water, room temperature
- 1/3 cup (3 ounces) mature `Sourdough Starter <#sourdough-starter>`__

Directions
----------
1. Whisk flour and salt together in medium bowl. Whisk room-temperature water
   and starter in large bowl until smooth. Add flour mixture to water mixture
   and stir using wooden spoon, scraping up dry flour from bottom of bowl
   until dough comes together, then knead by hand in bowl until shaggy ball
   forms and no dry flour remains. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sit at
   room temperature for at least 12 hours or up to 18 hours.
2. Lay 12 by 12-inch sheet of parchment paper on counter and spray generously
   with vegetable oil spray. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter and
   knead 10 to 15 times. Shape dough into ball by pulling edges into middle.
   Transfer dough, seam side down, to center of parchment. Pick up dough by
   lifting parchment edges and lower into heavy-bottomed Dutch oven. Cover
   with plastic wrap.
3. Adjust oven rack to middle position and place loaf or cake pan in bottom of
   oven. Place pot on middle rack and pour 3 cups of boiling water into pan
   below. Close oven door and let dough rise until doubled in size and does
   not readily spring back when poked with your floured finger, 2 to 3 hours.
4. Remove pot and water pan from oven; discard plastic from pot. Lightly flour
   top of dough and, using razor blade or sharp knife, make one 7-inch-long,
   1/2-inch-deep slit along top of dough. Cover pot and place on middle rack
   in oven. Heat oven to 425 degrees. Bake bread for 30 minutes (starting
   timing as soon as you turn on oven).
5. Remove lid and continue to bake until loaf is deep brown and registers
   210 degrees, 20 to 30 minutes longer. Carefully remove bread from pot;
   transfer to wire rack and let cool completely before serving.

Sourdough Starter
=================

Source: `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/9075-sourdough-starter>`__

Ingredients
-----------
- 4 1/2 cups (24 3/4 ounces) whole-wheat flour
- 5 cups (25 ounces) all-purpose flour, plus extra for maintaining starter
- Water, room temperature

Directions
----------
1. Combine whole-wheat flour and all-purpose flour in large container. Using
   wooden spoon, mix 1 cup (5 ounces) flour mixture and 2/3 cup (5 1/3 ounces)
   room-temperature water in glass bowl until no dry flour remains (reserve
   remaining flour mixture). Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room
   temperature until bubbly and fragrant, 48 to 72 hours.
2. FEED STARTER: Measure out 1/4 cup (2 ounces) starter and transfer to clean
   bowl or jar; discard remaining starter. Stir 1/2 cup (2 1/2 ounces) flour
   mixture and 1/4 cup (2 ounces) room-temperature water into starter until
   no dry flour remains. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room
   temperature for 24 hours.
3. Repeat step 2 every 24 hours until starter is pleasantly aromatic and
   doubles in size 8 to 12 hours after being fed, 10 to 14 days. At this point
   starter is mature and ready to be baked with, or it can be moved to storage.
   (If baking, use starter once it has doubled in size during 8-to-12-hour
   window. Use starter within 1 hour after it starts to deflate once reaching
   its peak.)
4. TO STORE AND MAINTAIN MATURE STARTER: Measure out 1/4 cup (2 ounces)
   starter and transfer to clean bowl; discard remaining starter. Stir
   1/2 cup (2 1/2 ounces) all-purpose flour and 1/4 cup (2 ounces)
   room-temperature water into starter until no dry flour remains. Transfer
   to clean container that can be loosely covered (plastic container or mason
   jar with its lid inverted) and let sit at room temperature for 5 hours.
   Cover and transfer to refrigerator. If not baking regularly, repeat
   process weekly.
5. TO PREPARE FOR BAKING: Eighteen to 24 hours before baking, measure out
   1/2 cup (4 ounces) starter and transfer to clean bowl; discard remaining
   starter. Stir 1 cup (5 ounces) all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup (4 ounces)
   room-temperature water into starter until no dry flour remains. Cover and
   let sit at room temperature for 5 hours. Measure out amount of starter
   called for in bread recipe and transfer to second bowl. Cover and
   refrigerate for at least 12 hours or up to 18 hours. Remaining starter
   should be refrigerated and maintained as directed.
