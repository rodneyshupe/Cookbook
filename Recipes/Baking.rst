60-Minute Bread
===============

Source: The Minimalist Cooks Dinner by Mark Bittman

Ingredients
-----------

- 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed
- 2 teaspoons instant yeast, such as SAF
- 2 teaspoons salt

Directions
----------

1. Combine the flour, yeast, and salt in a bowl or food processor. Add
   1 1/4 cups warm water all at once, stirring with a wooden spoon or
   mixing with the machine on. Continue to mix, for a minute or two longer
   by hand, about 30 seconds total with the food processor. Add additional
   water by the tablespoon if necessary, until a ball forms.
2. Shape the dough into a flat round or long loaf, adding only enough flour
   to allow you to handle the dough. Place the dough on a baking sheet or a
   well-floured pizza peel. Let it rise in the warmest place in your
   kitchen, covered, while you preheat the oven to 425°F. (If you have time,
   let it rise for an hour or so.)
3. Bake the bread on a sheet, or slide it onto a baking stone. Bake until
   done, 30 to 45 minutes; the crust will be golden-brown, crisp, and firm.

   bowl with cornmeal mixture and, using rubber spatula, fold together

4. Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in 10-inch cast-iron skillet over
   medium heat. Scrape batter into skillet and spread into even layer.

   out clean, 23 to 28 minutes. Let cool on wire rack for 5 minutes.
