=======================


Ingredients
-----------

-  2 racks pork ribs (I prefer to use side ribs)

-  1 cup `Kansas City Style Sweet and Smoky Barbecue
   Sauce <#kansas-city-style-sweet-and-smoky-barbecue-sauce>`__
-  2 cups wood chips, preferably apple wood, soaked in 2 cups apple
   cider for 1 hour then drained
-  4 tbsp butter, softened
-  3 tbsp brown sugar
-  3 tbsp agave syrup (may substitute with honey)

Mop Sauce
^^^^^^^^^

-  1/2 cup Apple Cider Vinegar
-  1/2 tbsp vegetable oil
-  1 tbsp `Basic Barbecue Rub <#basic-barbecue-rub>`__
-  1/4 tbsp lemon juice
-  1/2 cup Coke
-  1/2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce


Directions
----------

1. Remove the papery skin on the back of each rack of ribs by pulling it
   off in a sheet with your fingers or a pair of pliers.
2. Spread mustard all over the ribs then sprinkle rub on both sides
   patting it in with your fingers. Cover and marinate in the
   refrigerator for 1 - 4 hours.
3. Mix together Mop Sauce ingredients.
4. Set up the smoker to 240°F, and enough wood for 2 hours of smoke.
   Once up to temperature place the ribs on racks and place in smoker
   for 2 hours. Baste with mop sauce every 30 minutes.
5. After the 2 hours remove ribs from smoker and baste one last time
   with mop sauce, spread 2 tablespoons of butter on each rack then
   sprinkle with 1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar and 1 1/2 tablespoons
   agave syrup. Finally wrap ribs in foil and return to smoker for 1 1/2
   hours. When done the meat will be very tender and will have pulled
   back from the ends of the bones.
6. Remove ribs from foil and brush ribs with half of the cup of Barbecue
   sauce. (Set aside the other half for serving on the side at the
   table.)
7. Return ribs to smoker and continue cooking while sauce sets
   (approximately 15 minutes.)
8. Transfer the ribs to a platter. Sprinkle with the remaining rub and
