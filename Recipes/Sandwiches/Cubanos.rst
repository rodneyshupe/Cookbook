Source: `Cook's Country <https://www.cookscountry.com/recipes/2924-cuban-sandwiches>`__

Makes 4 sandwiches.

Ingredients
-----------
- 1/3 cup diced dill pickles
- 1/3 cup diced jarred banana peppers
- 4 potato sandwich rolls (Kaiser rolls can be substituted)
- 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 1 1/2 tablespoons yellow mustard, such as French's
- 1/4 pound (113g) thinly sliced baked ham, preferably Virginia or Black Forest
- 1/2 pound (225g) cold roast pork, sliced thin
- 1/4 pound (113g) thinly sliced Swiss cheese
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

Directions
----------
1. Combine pickles and peppers in small bowl. Split rolls in half; spread top
   half with mayonnaise and bottom half with mustard. Layer ham, roast pork,
   pickle mixture, and cheese onto bottom half, finishing with cheese on top.
   Set tops of rolls in place and press down to flatten sandwiches.
2. Heat large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat for 4 minutes. Meanwhile,
   heat large pot or Dutch oven over medium-low heat for 4 minutes. Brush
   tops of sandwiches with melted butter and place in skillet buttered side
   down. Brush bottoms of rolls with remaining butter and use preheated pot
   to compress sandwiches for 15 to 20 seconds. Cook (keeping pot on
   sandwiches but not pressing down) until first side is golden brown, 3 to
   5 minutes. Remove pot, flip sandwiches over, replace pot on top of
   sandwiches, and cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes.
   Serve immediately.
