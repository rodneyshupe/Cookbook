Air Fryer Bacon
===============

Ingredients
-----------

- 5 slices bacon (regular bacon or thick-cut)

Directions
----------

1. Place the bacon strips in a single layer in the air fryer basket. (Cut
   strips in half if needed to fit more.)
2. Air fry regular cut bacon at 350ËšF for 7-9 minutes, or until bacon is
   browned and reaches desired crispiness. Air fry thick-cut bacon for
   10-12 minutes.
3. Transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate then serve. If cooking bacon
   in batches, be sure to discard any oil in the drip pan before repeating
   the process.
