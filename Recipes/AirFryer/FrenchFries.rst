Ingredients
-----------

- 1 1/2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- Salt and pepper

Directions
----------

1. Cut potatoes lengthwise into 1/2-inch-thick planks. Stack 3 or 4 planks
   and cut into 1/2-inch-thick sticks; repeat with remaining planks.
2. Submerge potatoes in large bowl of water and rinse to remove excess
   starch. Drain potatoes and repeat process as needed until water remains
   clear. Cover potatoes with hot tap water and let sit for 10 minutes.
   Drain potatoes, transfer to paper towelâ€“lined rimmed baking sheet, and
   thoroughly pat dry.
3. Toss potatoes with 1 tablespoon oil in clean, dry bowl, then transfer
   to air-fryer basket. Place basket in air fryer, set temperature to
   350 degrees, and cook for 8 minutes. Transfer potatoes to now-empty bowl
   and gently toss to redistribute. Return potatoes to air fryer and cook
   until softened and potatoes have turned from white to blond (potatoes
   may be spotty brown at tips), 5 to 10 minutes.
4. Transfer potatoes to now-empty bowl and toss with remaining 1 tablespoon
   oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Return potatoes to air fryer, increase
   temperature to 400 degrees, and cook until golden brown and crisp,
   15 to 20 minutes, tossing gently in bowl to redistribute every
   5 minutes. Transfer fries to large plate and season with salt and pepper
   to taste. Serve immediately.
