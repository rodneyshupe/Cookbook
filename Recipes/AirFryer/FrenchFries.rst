How to make PERFECT crispy air fryer French fries from scratch. Ready in no
time with little oil. Healthier and better than fast food fries!

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 large or 2 small/medium russet potatoes* (or Yukon gold potatoes, about 1 pound)
- 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil**
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (plus additional for serving)
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- OPTIONAL: 1/2 teaspoon dried dill weed (Italian seasoning, or dried herbs of choice (see blog post above for more ideas)
- OPTIONAL: pinch cayenne pepper (see blog post above for more ideas)
- Toppings (optional fresh parsley, chives, freshly grated Parmesan cheese (or nutritional yeast)

Directions
----------

1. Scrub the potatoes and peel if desired (I leave the peels on). Slice in
   half lengthwise, then cut into 1/4-inch-wide slices (a mandoline is the
   best way to get even fries; watch your fingers!). Turn the slices on
   their sides and cut into 1/4-inch sticks. If the sticks are long, cut
   them in half so that your fries are about 3 to 4 inches.
2. Place the potatoes in a large bowl, then pour very hot tap water over
   the top so that it covers the potatoes by at least 1 inch. Let sit 10
   minutes. &lt;â€”Must do! If you skip the soaking step, the fries will not
   be as crisp.
3. If you'd like to keep the fries warm between batches, preheat the oven
   to 200F and keep a baking sheet handy.
4. Preheat the air fryer to 375F according to the manufacturer's
   instructions. (For my air fryer, that is 3 minutes of preheat time).
5. Drain the potatoes, then transfer them to a clean towel and dry as
   completely as you can, changing the towel as needed. Rinse and wipe out
   the bowl you soaked the potatoes in, then return the potatoes to the
   bowl.
6. Drizzle the potatoes with the olive oil and sprinkle with salt, garlic
   powder, black pepper, and any other desired seasonings. Toss to coat,
   making sure the spices and oil are well distributed.
7. FOR FAIRLY CRISPY, SATISFYING FRIES IN FEWER BATCHES: Place the potatoes
   in the air fryer basket, doing no more than two layers (my air fryer is
   5 1/2 quarts and I can add about 1/3 of the fries). Make sure the fries
   are not completely packed together so that the air has plenty of room to
   circulate. Cook the fries for 5 minutes. Slide the basket out and use
   tongs to toss the fries. Return to the air fryer and continue cooking
   for 3 to 7 additional minutes, until crispy and golden brown. The time
   can vary by several minutes based on your air fryer model. Check on them
   a few times during the last few minutes to make sure they don't burn and
   make note of the time for future batches.
8. FOR MAXIMUM CRISPY FRIES IN MORE BATCHES: Place the potatoes in just one
   layer in the basket, being careful that they don&#039;t touch much or
   overlap. Cook for 4 minutes, slide the basket out and flip with tongs,
   then continue cooking for 4 to 8 additional minutes, until the fries are
   as crispy as you would like (again, the time will vary based on your
   model, so check them several times during the last few minutes and
   adjust as needed).
9. Remove the fries to a baking sheet or serving plate and immediately
   sprinkle with kosher salt.
10. Repeat with remaining potatoes, keeping the cooked fries warm on a
    baking sheet in the oven between batches as desired. Discard any liquid
    the potatoes have given off that has collected at the bottom of the
    bowl. Sprinkle with any extra desired toppings. Enjoy!
