^^^^^^^^

- 1/2 cup milk
- 1/4 cip plus 1 teaspoon granulated sugar, divided
- 1 (7g) packet or 2 1/4 teaspoon active-dry yeast
- 2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 4 tablespoon butter, melted
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Glaze
^^^^^

- 1/2 cup powdered sugar
- 1/8 cup milk
- 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon maple flavor, or to taste, optional

Chocolate Glaze
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- 6 tablespoons cup powdered sugar
- 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 1/2 tablespoons milk

Cinnamon Sugar
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- 2 tablespoons melted butter

Directions
----------

1. Doughnuts: Grease a large bowl with cooking spray. In a small,
   microwave-safe bowl or glass measuring cup, add milk. Microwave until
   lukewarm, 40 seconds. Add a teaspoon of sugar and stir to dissolve, then
   sprinkle over yeast and let sit until frothy, about 8 minutes.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour and salt. In standing mixer bowl, 
   whisk together remaining 1/4 cup sugar, butter, egg, and vanilla. Pour
   in yeast mixture, mix to combine, then add in dry ingredients, and mix
   on low using dough hook until a shaggy dough forms.  
3. Increase to medium and knead until elastic and only slightly tacky,
   adding more flour a teaspoon at a time if needed, about 5 minutes.
4. Remove from dough hook and form into a ball then place dough in oiled
   bowl and cover with a clean dish towel. Let dough rise in a warm spot
   until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
5. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly grease with
   cooking spray. Punch down dough, then turn onto a lightly floured work
   surface and roll out into a 1/4" thick rectangle.
6. Using a doughnut cutter or 3" and 1" biscuit cutters, punch out your
   doughnuts. Knead any scraps together and punch out more doughnuts or
   holes. Place doughnuts and holes onto baking sheets, cover
   with dish towel, and let rise again, 40 minutes to 1 hour more.
7. Grease basket of air fryer with cooking spray and add 2 doughnuts and 2
   doughnut holes at a time, making sure doughnuts don't touch. Cook at
   375Â° for 4 minutes, until deeply golden. Place on cooling rack and
   repeat with remaining dough.
8. GLAZE: In a medium bowl whisk together glaze ingredients. Dip doughnuts
   in glaze (see below) or for cinnamon sugar, brush doughnuts with melted
   butter and toss in cinnamon sugar. Return to cooling rack and let set
   for 5 minutes before serving.

Note
----

Each glaze is enough for 4 doughnuts.  Scale up as necessary.
