Ingredients
-----------

- 3 baking potatoes
- 1/2 Tablespoon olive oil
- 1/2 Tablespoon Kosher salt

Directions
----------

1. Wash and dry the potatoes. Put the oil in a bowl and rub it on the
   potatoes. Spinkle salt over the potatoes.
2. Put the potatoes in an air fryer basket, leaving space around them for
   air to circulate. Cook at 400 F for 30 minutes, turning over after
   15 minutes.
3. Test for the potatoes doneness by seeing if a fork goes into them
   easily. Or check the temperature with an instant read thermometer. They
   are done if they are at about 205 F. Put them back in for another
   10 minutes if necessary.
