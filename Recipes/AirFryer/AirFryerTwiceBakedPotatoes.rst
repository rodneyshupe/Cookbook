Ingredients
-----------

- 3 cooked `baked potatoes <#air-fryer-baked-potatoes>`__
- 3 tablespoon sour cream
- 2/3 cup cheddar cheese
- 1 1/2 tablespoon butter
- 3 slices `cooked bacon <#air-fryer-bacon>`__

Directions
----------

1. Cut the baked potatoes in half and scoop out the insides into a bowl.
2. Add the sour cream, 1/3 cup of cheddar cheese and the butter to the bowl
   with the potatoes. Mash the potatoes and other ingredients together with
   a potato masher until they have reached your desired consistency.
3. Spoon the filling back into the potato shells, mounding it to fit as
   necessary. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
4. When you are ready to bake the potatoes put them in an air fryer basket.
   Cook at 400 F for 8 minutes.
5. Top the potatoes with the remaining 1/3 cup of cheddar cheese and bacon 
   bits. Be careful not to touch the hot sides of the air fryer basket
   while you do this. Return the potatoes to the air fryer and cook for
   2 more minutes at 400F to melt the cheese and crisp the bacon.
