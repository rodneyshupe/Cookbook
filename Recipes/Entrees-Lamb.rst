+----------------------+-------------------------+-------------------+

Ingredients
-----------

-  1 rack lamb separated into individual chops
-  4 cloves garlic, crushed
-  1 teaspoon salt
-  1/4 cup dijon mustard
-  2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
-  3 teaspoons fresh rosemary, chopped

   Whisk in oil in a slow, steady stream.
2. Place the individual lamb chops in a heavy duty resealable bag, and
   add the marinade. Refrigerate at least 6 hours, but preferably
   overnight.
3. Preheat barbecue on High. Reduce heat to Medium and lightly brush the
   cooking grids with vegetable or olive oil. Place the lamb chops on
   the grill 2 minutes. Give the lamb a quarter turn on the same side

Herbed Grill-Roasted Lamb
=========================

+---------------+-------------------+
| Total: 1 hour | Yield: 4 servings |
+---------------+-------------------+

Based on: `Molly Stevens <https://www.finecooking.com/recipe/herbed-grill-roasted-lamb>`__

Ingredients
-----------

- `Herb Mustard Rub <#herb-mustard-rub>`__
- 1 2-lb. boneless butterflied leg of lamb

Directions
----------

1. Lay the lamb flat on your work surface (it should be roughly
   rectangular) and trim any visible sinew, but don't trim anything
   that's holding together sections of the leg. Spread about a
   third of the rub on the surface of the lamb meat. Roll up the lamb
   tightly, from one short end to the other, and tie the roast snugly at
   1-inch intervals with kitchen twine. Spread the remaining herb rub all
   over the rolled, tied roast.
2. Heat grill with medium heat and setup for indirect grilling.  It should
   be between 325° and 375°F. Adjust if necessary.  Add roast and grill for
   about 20 minutes, use tongs or a meat fork to turn and rotate
   the roast to help it cook evenly. Turn the roast so the side that was
   farthest from the fire is now closest to it, but keep it on the cool
   side of the grill.
3. Check the roast with an instant-read thermometer to determine when
   it’s done; the middle of the thickest section, should read 125°F for
   medium rare (about 20 minutes after turning the roast). When the lamb
   has reached the desired doneness, use tongs or a meat fork to roll it
   briefly over the hot side of the fire to sear the outside, turning it
   until all sides are seared, about 2 minutes per side. Cover the lamb
   with foil and let it rest for 10 to 15 minutes before carving.

Yogurt-Marinated Grilled Boneless Leg of Lamb
=============================================

Source: `West of the Loop <https://www.westoftheloop.com/2015/12/15/grilled-boneless-leg-of-lamb/>`__

Ingredients
-----------
- 5 lb. boneless leg of lamb
- 1 cup Greek yogurt
- Zest and juice of one lemon
- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tsp oregano, preferably Greek
- Salt and pepper

Directions
----------
1. Lay the lamb flat on a cutting board and trim the visible pockets of
   interior fat, leaving the fat cap on the exterior. Season the lamb well
   with salt and pepper.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together the yogurt, lemon zest and juice,
   olive oil, garlic and oregano. Rub the marinade all over the lamb and
   place lamb in a gallon-sized plastic big. Refrigerate the lamb for at
   least one hour and up to 3 hours.
3. Remove lamb prior to cooking and allow to come to room temperature. Heat
   grill to medium heat. Cook lamb, turning once, until it reaches an
   internal temperature of 125 degrees for medium-rare, about 20 minutes.
4. Allow lamb to rest, loosely tented with foil, for at least twenty minutes
   prior to carving. Slice against the grain into thin slices and serve.
   (Tzatziki sauce, harissa or mint jelly all make nice accompaniments.)
