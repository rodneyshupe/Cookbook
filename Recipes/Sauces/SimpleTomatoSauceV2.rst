Simple Tomato Sauce v2
======================

*Makes enough to dress 3/4 pound pasta; Serves 3*

Ingredients
-----------

-  1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes or whole tomatoes (1 can), not packed
   in puree or sauce
-  2 medium cloves garlic, peeled and chopped coarse
-  3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
-  2 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh basil leaves, (about 8 leaves)
-  1/4 teaspoon granulated sugar
-  1 1/2 teaspoons table salt

Directions
----------

1. If using diced tomatoes, go to step 2. If using whole tomatoes, drain
   and reserve liquid. Dice tomatoes either by hand or in work bowl of
   food processor fitted with metal blade (three or four pulses at 1/2
   second). Tomatoes should be coarse, with 1/4-inch pieces visible. If
   necessary, add enough reserved liquid to tomatoes to total 2 cups.
2. Process garlic through garlic press into small bowl; stir in 1
   teaspoon water. Heat oil and garlic in 10-inch saute pan over medium
   heat until fragrant but not brown, about 2 minutes. Stir in tomatoes;
   simmer until thickened slightly, about 10 minutes. Stir in basil,
   sugar, and salt, and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Serve
   over pasta.
