Bearnaise Sauce
===============

Ingredients
-----------

-  1/4 cup white wine vinegar
-  1/2 cup dry white wine
-  4 sprigs tarragon, leaves finely minced, stems reserved separately
-  1 small shallot, roughly chopped
-  1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
-  2 egg yolks
-  Kosher salt
-  1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter


Directions
----------

1. Combine vinegar, wine, herb stems, shallots, and black peppercorns in
   a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and lower
   heat to maintain a gently simmer. Cook until reduced to about 1 1/2
   tablespoons of liquid, about 15 minutes. Carefully strain liquid
   through a fine mesh strainer into a small bowl, pressing on the
   solids with the back of a spoon to extract as much liquid as
   possible.
2. Combine vinegar reduction, egg yolk, and a pinch of salt in the
   bottom of a cup that barely fits the head of an immersion blender.
   Melt butter in a small saucepan over high heat, swirling constantly,
   until foaming subsides. Transfer butter to a 1-cup liquid measuring
   cup.
3. Place head of immersion blender into the bottom of the cup and turn
   it on. With the blender constantly running, slowly pour hot butter
   into cup. It should emulsify with the egg yolk and vinegar reduction.
   Continue pouring until all butter is added. Sauce should be thick and
   creamy. If it is thin and runny, transfer to a large bowl set over a
   pot of barely simmering water. Whisk constantly and vigorously until
   sauce is thickened. Season to taste with salt. Whisk in chopped
   tarragon. Serve immediately, or transfer to a small lidded pot and
   keep in a warm place for up to 1 hour before serving. Bearnaise
   cannot be cooled and reheated.
