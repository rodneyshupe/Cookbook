Simple Apple Sauce
==================

Ingredients
-----------
- 4 pounds apples (8 to 12 medium), unpeeled, cored, and cut into rough
  1 1/2-inch pieces (McIntosh or Pink Lady apples are best but any variety
  but Red or Golden Delicious should work fine.)
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- Pinch table salt
- 1 cup water

Optional Flavorings
--------------------
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter - stir into finished sauce
- 3 inch cinnamon sticks (2) -- cook with apples and remove prior to pureeing
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon - stir into finished sauce
- 1 cup cranberries (fresh or frozen) - cook and puree with apples
- 4 whole cloves - cook with apples and remove prior to serving
- 1 1/2 inch piece fresh ginger, sliced into three pieces and smashed - cook
  with apples and remove prior to pureeing
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest - cook and puree with apples
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice - stir into finished sauce
- 2/3 cup Red Hot candy - cook and puree with apples
- 2 pieces star anise (whole) - cook with apples and remove prior to serving

Directions
----------
1. Toss apples, sugar, salt, and water in large, heavy-bottomed nonreactive
   Dutch oven. Cover pot and cook apples over medium-high heat until they
   begin to break down, 15 to 20 minutes, checking and stirring occasionally
   with wooden spoon to break up any large chunks.
2. Process cooked apples through food mill fitted with medium disk. Season
   with extra sugar or add water to adjust consistency as desired. Serve hot,
   warm, at room temperature, or chilled. (Can be covered and refrigerated
   for up to 5 days.)
