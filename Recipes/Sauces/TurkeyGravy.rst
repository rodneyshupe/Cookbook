Turkey Gravy
============


Ingredients
-----------

-  1 tablespoon vegetable oil
-  Reserved turkey giblets and neck
-  1 onion, unpeeled and chopped
-  4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
-  2 cups water
-  2 sprigs fresh thyme
-  8 parsley stems
-  3 tablespoons unsalted butter
-  1/4 cup all-purpose flour
-  1 cup dry white wine


Directions
----------

1.  Make the Broth: Heat oil in large saucepan over medium-high heat.
    Brown turkey giblets and neck for 5 minutes. Cook onion for 3
    minutes. Cover and cook over low heat for 20 minutes.
2.  Add chicken broth and water, scrape pan bottom, and bring to boil.
    Add herbs and simmer, skimming foam from surface, for 30 minutes.
3.  Pour broth through fine-mesh strainer. Reserve and dice heart and
    gizzard. Refrigerate broth and diced giblets until ready to use.
4.  Make the Roux and Thicken the Broth: Melt butter in large saucepan
    over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour. Cook, stirring constantly,
    until nutty brown and fragrant, 10 to 15 minutes. Bring reserved
    turkey broth to simmer.
5.  Gradually add hot turkey broth to roux. Vigorous and constant
    whisking at this point is key to avoiding lumps. Reserve 1 cup of
    broth for deglazing roasting pan (see #9).
6.  Simmer gravy, stirring occasionally and skimming scum from surface
    with spoon, until thickened, about 30 minutes. Set aside, covered,
    until turkey is done.
7.  Deglaze the Pan and Add the Drippings To the Gravy: Pour drippings
    through mesh strainer set over measuring cup. Let liquid settle
    until fat rises to top. Return vegetables in strainer to roasting
    pan.
8.  Tilt measuring cup and use wide, shallow soup spoon to skim fat off
    surface. Reserve defatted drippings. Return gravy in saucepan to
    simmer.
9.  Place roasting pan over two burners at medium-high heat. Add wine
    and reserved 1 cup broth and scrape up browned bits in pan. Boil
    until liquid reduces by half, 5 minutes.
10. Strain roasting pan liquid into gravy, pressing on solids to extract
    all liquid. Add defatted drippings to taste. Stir in giblets and
    serve.
