Teriyaki Sauce
==============

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 tablespoon of ginger, minced
- 1 clove of garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoons of oil
- 1/2 cup of sake
- 1/2 cup of mirin
- 1/2 cup of soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 2 tablespoon water
- 1/2 tablespoon of sesame seeds (optional)

Directions
----------

1. Put 1/2 tablespoon of oil in a sauce pan over low heat then add garlic and 
   ginger. On low heat, let bloom and become fragrant.
2. After about 3 minutes, add in equal parts of sake, mirin, and soy sauce.
   Bring to a boil and let the alcohol cook off. This will take about
   3-5 minutes on medium heat.
3. Once the sauce has reduced by about 1/3, mix together the corn starch and 
   water in a small bowl.
4. Drizzle in your corn starch slurry and give it a mix. Your teriyaki sauce
   should become nice and thick.
5. Finally add in about sesame seeds. Stir to combine and once the sauce is
   cooled store in an air tight jar.
