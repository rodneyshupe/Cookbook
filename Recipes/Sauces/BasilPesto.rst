Ingredients
-----------

- 1/4 cup pine nut, toasted (or substitute almonds or walnuts)
- 3 garlic clove, unpeeled
- 2 cups packed fresh basil leafNone
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley leaves(optional)
- 1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oilNone
- 1/2 teaspoon saltNone
- 1/4 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese or Pecorino Romano

Directions
----------

1. Toast the nuts in a small, heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring
   frequently, until just golden and fragrant, about 5 minutes; set aside.
   Add the garlic to the empty skillet and toast over medium heat, shaking
   the pan occasionally, until fragrant and the color of the cloves deepens
   slightly, about 7 minutes. Let the garlic cool slightly, then peel, and
   chop.
2. Place the basil and parsley (if using) in a heavy-duty 1-gallon zipper-
   lock plastic bag. Pound the bag with the flat side of a meat pounder or
   rolling pin until all the leaves are bruised.
3. Process the nuts, garlic, herbs, oil, and 1‚ÅÑ2 teaspoon salt in a food
   processor until smooth, stopping as necessary to scrape down the sides
   of the bowl, about 1 minute. Stir in the Parmesan and season with salt
   and pepper to taste.

Notes
-----

Pounding the basil releases its flavorful oils into the pesto more readily.
Basil usually darkens in homemade pesto, but you can boost the green color
a little by adding the optional parsley. For sharper flavor, substitute one
tablespoon finely grated pecorino Romano cheese for one tablespoon of the
Parmesan. The pesto can be kept in an airtight container, covered with a
thin layer of oil (1 to 2 tablespoons), and refrigerated for up to four
days or frozen for up to one month.
