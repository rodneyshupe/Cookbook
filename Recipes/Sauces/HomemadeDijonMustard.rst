Ingredients
-----------

- 3/4 cup white wine
- 1/3 cup white wine vinegar (original recipe calls for 1/4 cup)
- 1/2 cup water, plus more as needed
- 1/2 yellow onion, chopped
- 1 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/2 cup yellow mustard seeds
- 2 tablespoons mustard
- 1/2 tablespoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions
----------

1. Combine the white wine, vinegar, water, onion, and garlic in a saucepan.
   Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove
   from heat and allow to cool to room temperature. Strain the mixture
   through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing on the onions and garlic to extract
   all the juices. Discard the onion and garlic.
2. Combine the flavored vinegar liquid, mustard seed, dry mustard, garlic
   powder and salt in a quart-size mason jar. Cover and let stand at room
   temperature for 24 to 48 hours.
3. Pour the mixture into a blender and puree until it a creamy consistency.
   Pour into a saucepan, bring to a boil and then reduce the heat and
   simmer until the mixture is thickened but still pourable, about
   10 minutes.
4. If canning, have your water bath canner ready. Pour the hot mustard into
   clean pint-size or half-pint jars, leaving 1/2" headspace. Use a clean
   toothpick or spatula to release any trapped air in the mustard. Process
   for 10 minutes, adjusting for altitude.
5. Alternatively, allow the jars to cool and store in the refrigerator for
   up to three months.
