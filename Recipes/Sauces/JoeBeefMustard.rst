Ingredients
-----------

- 1/2 cup (90 g) mustard seeds
- 5 tablespoons (75 ml) water
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup
- Scant 2 tablespoons neutral oil
- 1 1/4 cups (300 ml) white wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon ground turmeric
- Pinch of cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon salt

Directions
----------

1. In a powerful food processor, combine the mustard seeds, water,
   maple syrup, oil, one-third of the vinegar, the turmeric, the cayenne,
   and the salt and process on high speed. (If it is not powerful, you
   will end up with more whole seeds, which is okay but not ideal.) Once
   you start, the seeds will bounce around like money in a money cage.
2. When the seeds stop bouncing around, slowly add the rest of the
   vinegar. When the blade stops spinning well and the mustard is thick,
   itâ€™s ready. Transfer to a tightly capped jar and store in the fridge
   for up to a month.
