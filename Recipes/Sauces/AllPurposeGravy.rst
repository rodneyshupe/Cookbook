All-Purpose Gravy
=================

Ingredients
-----------

-  1 small carrot, peeled and chopped into rough 1/2-inch pieces (about
   1/2 cup)
-  1 small rib celery, chopped into rough 1/2-inch pieces (about 1/2
   cup)
-  1 small onion, chopped into rough 1/2-inch pieces (about 3/4 cup)
-  3 tablespoons unsalted butter
-  1/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
-  2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
-  2 cups low-sodium beef broth
-  1 bay leaf
-  1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
-  5 whole black peppercorns
-  Salt and ground black pepper


Directions
----------

1. In food processor, pulse carrot until broken into rough 1/4-inch
   pieces, about five 1-second pulses. Add celery and onion; pulse until
   all vegetables are broken into 1/8-inch pieces, about five 1-second
   pulses.
2. Heat butter in large heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat;
   when foaming subsides, add vegetables and cook, stirring frequently,
   until softened and well browned, about 7 minutes. Reduce heat to
   medium; stir in flour and cook, stirring constantly, until thoroughly
   browned and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Whisking constantly, gradually
   add broths; bring to boil, skimming off any foam that forms on
   surface. Reduce heat to medium-low and add bay leaf, thyme, and
   peppercorns; simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened and
   reduced to 3 cups, 20 to 25 minutes.
3. Strain gravy through fine-mesh strainer into clean saucepan, pressing
   on solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard solids.
   Adjust seasonings with salt and pepper. Serve hot.
