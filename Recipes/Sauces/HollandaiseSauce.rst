Hollandaise Sauce
=================

Ingredients
-----------

-  1 egg yolk
-  1 teaspoon water
-  1 teaspoon lemon juice from 1 lemon
-  Kosher salt
-  8 tablespoons butter (1 stick)
-  Pinch cayenne pepper or 1 dash hot sauce (if desired)
-  1 dash worcestershire sauce (if desired)

Directions
----------

1. Combine egg yolk, water, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt in the
   bottom of a cup that barely fits the head of an immersion blender.
   Melt butter in a small saucepan over high heat, swirling constantly,
   until foaming subsides. Transfer butter to a 1 cup liquid measuring
   cup.
2. Place head of immersion blender into the bottom of the cup and turn
   it on. With the blender constantly running, slowly pour hot butter
   into cup. It should emulsify with the egg yolk and lemon juice.
   Continue pouring until all butter is added. Sauce should be thick and
   creamy. Season to taste with salt and a pinch of cayenne pepper or
   hot sauce (if desired) and worcestershire sauce (if desired). Serve
   immediately, or transfer to a small lidded pot and keep in a warm
   place for up to 1 hour before serving.
   Hollandaise cannot be cooled and reheated.

Variation
