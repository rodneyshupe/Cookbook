- 1 1/3 cups beef broth (reduced sodium)

- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/4 teaspoon ground thyme
- 2-3 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce

- salt and pepper to taste

Directions

1. In a medium sauce pan bring broth to boil over medium-high heat.
   Stir in onion powder, garlic powder, thyme, and Worcestershire sauce.
2. In a small bowl whisk together cold water and corn starch until
   dissolved. Whisk into boiling beef broth and reduce heat to medium-lowR
   and simmer until gravy is thickened to your liking.
3. Season with salt and pepper. Taste, add more salt and pepper if needed,
   and taste again to make sure it's just right.
4. Remove from heat and optionally whisk in butter.  Serve immediately or
   cool and refrigerate for up to 5 days.

Variations
----------

* ROUX – If you want to use a roux, start out with 2 tablespoons unsalted
  butter in the saucepan, and heat until melted.  Whisk in 2 Tbsp all
  purpose flour and cook about 1 minute. Slowly add in broths, whisking
  the mixture as you pour, until mixture is smooth.  Proceed with recipe as
  written, omitting the water and cornstarch.
* DRIPPINGS – Substitute them for some of the broth.
* BROTH – for a beefier flavor, try using all beef broth (2 cups).  For a
  lighter flavor, and color, increase the amount of chicken broth and
  reduce the amount of beef.  Just keep it at 2 cups total.
* ONION – Finely mince some onion and saute it in the saucepan with a drizzle
  of oil over MED heat for about 5 minutes.  Then add broth and continue with
  the recipe as written.
* FRESH HERBS – try adding a sprig or two of fresh thyme or rosemary to the
  saucepan with the broth.  It adds a beautiful herby flavor!  Just remember
  to remove the woody stems before serving.
* MUSHROOMS – Saute sliced mushrooms in the saucepan with a drizzle of oil
  over MED heat for about 5 minutes.  Then add broth and continue with the
  recipe as written.
