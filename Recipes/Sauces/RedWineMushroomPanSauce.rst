Ingredients
-----------

-  1 tablespoon vegetable oil
-  8 ounces button mushrooms, trimmed and sliced thin (about 3 cups)
-  1 small shallot, minced (about 1 1/2 tablespoons)
-  1 cup dry red wine
-  1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth
-  1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
-  1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
-  2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces
-  1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves
-  Salt and ground black pepper


Directions
----------

Pour off any fat from skillet in which steaks were cooked. Heat oil over
medium-high heat until just smoking. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring
occasionally, until beginning to brown and liquid has evaporated, about
5 minutes. Add shallot and cook, stirring frequently, until beginning to
soften, about 1 minute. Increase heat to high; add red wine and broth,
scraping bottom of skillet with wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits.
Simmer rapidly until liquid and mushrooms are reduced to 1 cup, about 6
minutes. Add vinegar, mustard, and any juices from resting steaks; cook
until thickened, about 1 minute. Off heat, whisk in butter and thyme;
season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon sauce over steaks and serve
immediately.
