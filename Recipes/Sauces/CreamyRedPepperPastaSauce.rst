Sauce
^^^^^

1. Preheat a large saut√© pan, add a few tablespoons of olive oil and then
   get the onions in first to get them going. Season with salt and once
   softened and begins to turn translucent, add the peppers. Cook for a few
   minutes until the onions are fully translucent and soft and starting to
   brown slightly.
2. Add the garlic, chili flake, Calabrian chilis and cook until the garlic
   softens and begins to slightly brown around the edges.
3. Add two tablespoons of tomato paste and then incorporate that into the
   vegetables and cook for 2-3 minutes.
4. Add cream, lower the heat to medium and cook for about 5 minutes or until
   the cream has thickened. Let cool slightly and then blend until smooth.

Serving
^^^^^^^

1. Get a pot of salted water up to a boil add 1 lb pasta (tube based basta
   works best here such as Cavatappi, Penne or Rigatoni) to the water and
   start to cook the pasta.
2. Add the sauce back to the pan and get it on a lower heat until the pasta
   is cooked. Slowly melt in a tablespoon of cold butter and adjust the
   seasoning before adding the pasta.
3. 1-2 minutes before the pasta is perfectly cooked, add it to the sauce with
   a tablespoon or two of the pasta water, marry the sauce and the pasta
   until the pasta becomes perfectly al dente.
4. Turn the heat off, toss in some pecorino Romano until creamy and thickened
   and then plate with a bit more pecorino cheese and enjoy.
