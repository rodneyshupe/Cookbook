Sauce Base (Demi-glace)
=======================

Source: `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/1431-sauce-base-for-steak-diane-demi-glace>`__

This recipe yields a sauce base that is an excellent facsimile of a demi-glace,
a very labor-intensive and time-consuming classic French sauce base. Because
the sauce base is very concentrated, make sure to use low-sodium chicken and
beef broths; otherwise, the base may be unpalatably salty.

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 4 teaspoons tomato paste
- 2 small onions, chopped medium (about 1 1/3 cups)
- 1 medium carrot, chopped medium (about 1/2 cup)
- 4 medium cloves garlic, peeled
- 1/4 cup water
- 4 teaspoons unbleached all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 cups dry red wine
- 3 1/2 cups low-sodium beef broth
- 1 3/4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 2 teaspoons black peppercorns
- 8 sprigs fresh thyme
- 2 bay leaves

Directions
----------

1. Heat oil and tomato paste in Dutch oven over medium-high heat; cook,
   stirring constantly, until paste begins to brown, about 3 minutes. Add
   onions, carrot, and garlic; cook, stirring frequently, until mixture is
   reddish brown, about 2 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons water and continue to
   cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is well browned, about 3 minutes,
   adding remaining water when needed to prevent scorching. Add flour and
   cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute. Add wine and, using a heatproof
   rubber spatula, scrape up browned bits on bottom and sides of pot; bring
   to boil, stirring occasionally (mixture will thicken slightly). Add beef
   and chicken broths, peppercorns, thyme, and bay; bring to boil and cook,
   uncovered, occasionally scraping bottom and sides of pot with spatula,
   until reduced to 2 1/2 cups, 35 to 40 minutes.
2. Strain mixture through fine-mesh strainer, pressing on solids to extract
   as much liquid as possible; you should have about 1 1/4 cups.

Notes
-----

* The sauce base can be made ahead and refrigerated for up to three days.
* To Freeze For Another Use:After straining the sauce base, portion the
  sauce into plastic ice cube trays and freeze. Use these cubes to create a
  quick sauce for grilled, broiled, or pan-seared steaks or chops.
* Variations:To make a very potent sauce for two people, melt two demi-glace
  cubes in a small skillet and finish by whisking in 1/2 tablespoon unsalted
  butter. For a less rich sauce that can serve four, melt two demi-glace
  cubes with 2 tablespoons water and then finish with 1/2 tablespoon butter.
  Either way, the sauce base already has highly concentrated flavors, so you
  will probably not need to season this quick sauce with salt and pepper.
