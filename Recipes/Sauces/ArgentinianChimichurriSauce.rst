- 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
- 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil

   minutes to soften oregano. Pulse parsley, cilantro, garlic, and pepper
   flakes in food processor until coarsely chopped, about 10 pulses.

   mixture to medium bowl and slowly whisk in oil until incorporated and
   mixture is emulsified.
