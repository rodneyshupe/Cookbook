Garlic Chili Oil
================

Ingredients
-----------

- 1/4 cup avocado oil or vegetable oil
- 3 - 4 cloves garlic, peeled and thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds
- 1 tablespoon crushed red chili flakes

Directions
----------

1. Add crushed red chili flakes to a small heat-safe bowl and set aside.
2. Heat 1/4 cup oil in a small pot over medium heat.
3. Once hot, add thinly sliced garlic and pan fry, stirring often, until
   garlic is just beginning to turn golden, approx. 2 minutes.
4. Stir in sesame seeds and cook an additional minute until garlic is crisp
   and toasty. Take care not to overcook the garlic as it will continue
   crisping once removed from heat.
5. Carefully transfer mixture to the red pepper flake bowl. Mix well and
   allow to cool.
