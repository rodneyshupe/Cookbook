Beer Can Chicken
================

Ingredients
-----------

-  1 large whole chicken (3 to 5 pounds)
-  3 tablespoons `Basic Barbecue Rub <#basic-barbecue-rub>`__
-  1 can (12 ounces) beer

Directions
----------

1. Remove and discard the fat just inside the body cavities of the
   chicken. Remove the package of giblets, and set aside for another
   use. Rinse the chicken, inside and out, under cold running water,
   then drain and blot dry, inside and out, with paper towels. Sprinkle
   1 tablespoon of the rub inside the body and neck cavities, the rub
   another 1 tablespoon all over the skin of the bird. If you wish, rub
   another 1/2 tablespoon of the mixture between the flesh and the skin.
   Cover and refrigerate the chicken while you preheat the grill.
2. Set up the grill for indirect grilling placing a drip pan in the
   center. If using a charcoal grill, preheat it to medium. If using a
   gas grill, place all the wood chips in the smoker box and preheat the
   grill to high; then, when smoke appears, lower the heat to medium.
3. Pop the tab on the beer can. Using a “church key” style can opener,
   make 6 or 7 holes in the top of the can. Pour out the top inch of
   beer, then spoon the remaining dry rub through the holes into the
   beer. Holding the chicken upright, with the opening of the body
   cavity down, insert the beer can into the cavity.
4. When ready to cook, if using charcoal, toss half the wood chips on
   the coals. Oil the grill grate. Stand the chicken up in the center of
   the hot grate, over the drip pan. Spread out the legs to form a sort
   of tripod, to support the bird.
5. Cover the grill and cook the chicken until fall-off-the-bone tender,
   2 hours. If using charcoal, add 10 to 12°Fresh coals per side and the
   remaining wood chips after 1 hour.
6. Using tongs, lift the bird to a cutting board or platter, holding the
   metal spatula underneath the beer can for support. (Have the board or
   platter right next to the bird to make the move shorter. Be careful
   not to spill hot beer on yourself.) Let stand for 5 minutes before
   carving the meat off the upright carcass. (Toss the beer can out
   along with the carcass.)

Wet Rub Variation
-----------------

-  1/4 cup light-packed brown sugar
-  2 tablespoons dijon mustard (with white wine)
-  1 1/2 tablespoon Spanish smoked paprika
-  1/2 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
-  1/2 tablespoon kosher salt
-  1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together brown sugar, mustard, paprika,
   balsamic, salt, and pepper. Brush rub over chickens and massage to
   season every part of the bird (including under the skin).
2. Cook chicken at 350°F for 1 hour 15 min. Test internal temp in thigh,
   should be 165°F.

Source: `Aussie BBQ Forum - Captain Cook <https://www.aussiebbq.info/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=65>`__

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 teaspoon mustard powder
- 6 cups water
- olive oil
- lemon pepper
- herbs de provence

----------
1. Mix brine ingredients together in a glass bowl Place chicken in a Ziploc
   bag and pour in brine solution. Seal and place in the fridge for 4-5 hours.
2. Remove, rinse with fresh water, pat dry and stand upright over a dish or
   tray in the fridge overnight to let the skin dry.
3. `Spatchcock <https://www.marthastewart.com/1035187/how-spatchcock-chicken>`__
   (or butterfly) the chicken by removing the back bone and flatten.
4. Spread olive oil over chicken and then sprinkle liberally with lemon peppers
   and and herbs de provence.
5. Preheat the grill on high for 10 minutes. Roast the chicken indirectly on
   a roasting rack for about 15 minutes per lb until the internal meat
   temperature is 165°F.
6. Serve with fresh buttered rolls, salad and a bottle of bubbly.

Notes
-----
- The length of brining will determine the saltiness of the bird and how moist
  it will be, if you are going to smoke cook it, you could brine it for longer.
- You can adapt this for Turkey by doubling the quantity and brine the turkey
  for 8 hours instead of 4-5.
- A variation is to add fresh herbs or Chinese 5 spice to the brine.

Thai-Style Grilled Chicken (Gai Yang)
=====================================

+-----------------------+----------------------+--------------------------+-------------------+
| Prep Time: 15 minutes | Marinate: 6-24 hours | Cooking Time: 45 minutes | Yield: 4 servings |
+-----------------------+----------------------+--------------------------+-------------------+

Source: `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/9710-thai-grilled-cornish-hens-with-chili-dipping-sauce-gai-yang>`__

Ingredients
-----------

Hens
^^^^
- 4 Cornish game hens (1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds each), giblets discarded
- 1 cup fresh cilantro leaves and stems, chopped coarse
- 12 garlic cloves, peeled
- 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons ground white pepper
- 2 teaspoons ground coriander
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1/4 cup fish sauce

Dipping Sauce
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- 1/2 cup distilled white vinegar
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon minced Thai chiles
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions
----------
1. FOR THE HENS: Working with 1 hen at a time, place hens breast side down on
   cutting board and use kitchen shears to cut through bones on either side of
   backbones; discard backbones. Flip hens and press on breastbones to
   flatten. Trim any excess fat and skin.
2. Pulse cilantro leaves and stems, garlic, sugar, pepper, coriander, and salt
   in food processor until finely chopped, 10 to 15 pulses; transfer to small
   bowl. Add fish sauce and stir until marinade has consistency of loose paste.
3. Rub hens all over with marinade. Transfer hens and any excess marinade to
   1-gallon zipper-lock bag and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or up to
   24 hours, flipping bag halfway through marinating.
4. FOR THE DIPPING SAUCE: Bring vinegar to boil in small saucepan. Add sugar
   and stir to dissolve. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until vinegar
   mixture is slightly thickened, 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let vinegar
   mixture cool completely. Add chiles, garlic, and salt and stir until
   combined. Transfer sauce to airtight container and refrigerate until ready
   to use. (Sauce can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks. Bring to room
   temperature before serving.)
5. GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about
   15 minutes. Leave primary burner on high and turn off other burner(s).
   Adjust primary burner (or, if using three-burner grill, primary burner and
   second burner) as needed to maintain grill temperature between 400 and
   450°F.
6. Clean and oil cooking grate. Remove hens from bag, leaving any marinade
   that sticks to hens in place. Tuck wingtips behind backs and turn legs so
   drumsticks face inward toward breasts. Place hens, skin side up, on cooler
   side of grill (if using charcoal, arrange hens so that legs and thighs
   are facing coals). Cover and cook until skin is browned and breasts
   register 145 to 150°F, 30 to 35 minutes, rotating hens halfway
   through cooking.
7. Using tongs, carefully flip hens skin side down and move to hotter side of
   grill. Cover and cook until skin is crisp, deeply browned, and charred in
   spots and breasts register 160°F, 3 to 5 minutes, being careful to
   avoid burning.
8. Transfer hens, skin side up, to cutting board; tent with aluminum foil
   and let rest for 10 minutes. Slice each hen in half or into 4 pieces and
   serve, passing dipping sauce separately.

Buffalo Style Chicken Wings
===========================

Ingredients
-----------

-  6 tablespoons table salt (or 12 tablespoons kosher salt)
-  6 tablespoons sugar
-  12 whole chicken wings (about 2 1/2 pounds) separated into sections
   wingtips discarded
-  Ground black pepper
-  1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter
-  1 1/2 tablespoons Sriracha sauce (you can use Tabasco or Frank’s Hot
   Sauce as well)

Directions
----------

1. In gallon-sized zipper-lock plastic bag, dissolve salt and sugar in 1
   quart water. Add chicken; press out as much air as possible from bag
   and seal; refrigerate until fully seasoned, 30 minutes. Remove from
   brine, rinse well under running water, dry thoroughly with paper
   towels, and season with pepper.
2. Turn all burners on grill to high, close lid, and heat grill until
   hot, 10 to 15 minutes. Adjust one burner to medium and grill chicken
   pieces over it, turning once, until color is light spotty brown, skin
   has thinned, and fat has rendered, 15 to 20 minutes. Using tongs,
   move chicken pieces over burner still set on high, turning constantly
   to prevent charring, until wings are dark spotty brown and skin has
   crisped, 5 to 7 minutes longer.
3. Combine butter and Tabasco sauce and toss with finished wings.

Variations
----------

For plain wings, serve with a squeeze of lemon or lime, or with an
accompanying dipping sauce, if desired. If you want BBQ style, in step
two brush with your favorite BBQ Sauce.

Dave’s BBQ Chicken Wings
========================

Ingredients
-----------

-  6 tablespoons table salt (or 12 tablespoons kosher salt)
-  6 tablespoons sugar
-  12 whole chicken wings
-  `Basic Barbecue Rub <#basic-barbecue-rub>`__
-  `Cajun Spice Mix <#cajun-spice-mix>`__
-  Bacon Fat

Directions
----------

1. Dissolve sugar and salt in 4 cups of water in a one gallon-size zip
   lock freezer bag. Add chicken and press out as much air as possible
   from the bag and seal. Place in refrigerator for 30 minutes.
2. Remove chicken from brine and pat dry with paper towel. Apply equal
   amounts of Basic Barbecue Rub and Cajun Spice Mix or to taste, lay
   out in a cookie sheet with a wire rack so they are not overlapping
   and let sit in the fridge for at least 3-4 hours to dry.
3. When ready get the smoke going (or not) and put the wings on one side
   of the grill, that side on the lowest setting. The smoking side low
   to medium heat. Flip wings over after 15 minutes or more frequently
   if the heat is high, you are looking to get them smokey and dry.
   After about 30 minutes baste wings with melted bacon fat, flip and
   baste again you can do this a couple of times if you like. There
   should be no flare ups or little on the wing side but the low heat is
   to apply extra cooking/drying and prevents the worst of the fat build
   up.
4. Keep smoking and cooking until the skin is getting crispy. It should
   be greyish from the spices and smoke. At this point you can raise the
   heat and switch them to the smoking side to crisp up more, if you do
   it on the wings side get ready for lots of flames. When done to your
   liking take them off and pour on as much room temperature BBQ sauce
   as you like, we coated about half of each wing drizzling with a table
   spoon. Overall don’t cook them too long, 40-50 minutes total time
   from when they went on the grill.

Variation
---------

Alternate brine: Substitute sugar with 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce.

Roast Chicken with Lemon and Garlic
===================================

+----------------------+--------------------------+-------------------+
| Prep Time: 5 minutes | Cooking Time: 45 minutes | Yield: 4 servings |
+----------------------+--------------------------+-------------------+

This recipe eliminates one of the most common complaints about whole roast
chickens—that it’s hard to know when they’re cooked all the way through. This
recipe makes it easy to check for doneness with lots of visual cues that anyone
can follow, but if you have an instant-read thermometer, go ahead and use it.
Remove chicken from the oven when thickest part of thigh hits 160°F, and
carryover cooking will bring it up to 165°F.

Ingedients
----------
- 1 lemon
- 1 head of garlic
- 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter or extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 3–4 lb. whole chicken
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper

Directions
----------
1. Arrange a rack in center of oven; preheat to 425°F. Cut 1 lemon in half
   crosswise and remove any visible seeds. Cut 1 head of garlic in half
   crosswise. Melt ½ stick butter in a small saucepan or microwave in a small
   bowl.
2. Place 1 3–4-lb. whole chicken on a cutting board (best to use a plastic
   one you can sterilize) and pat dry with paper towels.  With chicken breast
   facing up and legs pointing toward you, use a sharp knife to slice through
   loose area of skin draped between leg and breast, making about a 3"-long
   incision. Continue cutting downward until you hit the joint that connects
   the thigh to the body, then stop (once you get through the skin, there’s
   not much there; if you are cutting through flesh, you’re too close to the
   breast). This exposes the leg joint, making it easy to tell if chicken is
   cooked. Repeat on second side.
3. Season every surface of chicken, including skin along backbone, inside
   cavity, under wings, and inside part of the leg you just exposed, with
   lots of salt and pepper. If you’re using kosher salt, it should take you
   4–5 generous pinches.
4. Transfer chicken breast side up to a large skillet. Arrange lemon and
   garlic cut sides down in skillet around chicken. Drizzle chicken all over
   with melted butter and transfer to oven.
5. Roast until chicken is nicely browned and cooked through, checking for
   doneness after 45 minutes. To check, carefully remove skillet from oven
   (the handle is hot!), poke a knife into leg joints, and pierce the meat.
   If juices run clear, chicken is done. If you see a rosy pink color, it
   needs more time. Continue to roast, checking every 5 minutes, until juices
   run clear. (If you’re not sure, you can also use the knife to lightly
   shred some of the meat along the thigh bone—the meat should look opaque
   and the fibers should separate easily.)
6. Let chicken rest in skillet at least 15 minutes before carving. Transfer
   chicken to a platter. Top with pan juices and serve with roasted lemon and
   garlic alongside.

   breasts register 160°F and thighs register 175°F, 25 to 35 minutes.
3. Transfer chicken to carving board and let rest, uncovered, for 20
   minutes before carving.
4. While chicken rests, remove all but 1 tablespoon of fat from
   now-empty skillet using large kitchen spoon, leaving any fond and jus
   in skillet. Place skillet over medium-high heat, add shallot, and
   cook until softened, about 2 minutes.
5. Stir in broth and mustard, scraping skillet bottom with wooden spoon
   to loosen fond. Simmer until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 3 minutes.
6. Off heat, whisk in butter, tarragon, and lemon juice. Season with
   pepper to taste; cover and keep warm.

Thyme-Sherry Vinegar Pan Sauce
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  In step 4 add 2 minced garlic cloves and 2 teaspoons chopped fresh
   thyme to pan with shallot. In step 6 replace lemon juice with sherry
   vinegar and leave out the tarragon.

Chicken and Sausage Gumbo
=========================

Source: `Cook’s
Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/9384-chicken-and-sausage-gumbo#>`__

Ingredients
-----------

-  1 cup (5 ounces) all-purpose flour
-  1 tablespoon vegetable oil
-  1 onion, chopped fine
-  1 green bell pepper, chopped fine
-  2 celery ribs, chopped fine
-  1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme
-  3 garlic cloves, minced
-  1 teaspoon paprika
-  2 bay leaves
-  1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
-  Salt and pepper
-  4 cups chicken broth, room temperature
-  2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed
-  8 ounces andouille sausage, halved and sliced 1/4 inch thick
-  6 scallions, sliced thin
-  1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar
-  Hot sauce

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425°F.
   Place flour in 12-inch skillet and bake, stirring occasionally, until
   color of ground cinnamon, 40 to 55 minutes. (As flour approaches
   desired color, it will take on very nutty aroma that will smell
   faintly of burnt popcorn, and it will need to be stirred more
   frequently.) Transfer flour to medium bowl and let cool. (Toasted
   flour can be stored in airtight container in cool, dark place for up
   to 6 months.)
2. Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion,
   bell pepper, and celery and cook, stirring frequently, until
   softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in thyme, garlic, paprika, bay leaves,
   cayenne, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and cook until
   fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in 2 cups broth. Add chicken in single
   layer (chicken will not be completely submerged in liquid) and bring
   to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken
   is fork-tender, 15 to 17 minutes. Transfer chicken to plate.
3. Slowly whisk remaining 2 cups broth in small increments into toasted
   flour until thick, smooth, batter-like paste forms. Increase heat to
   medium and slowly whisk paste into gumbo, making sure each addition
   is incorporated before adding next. Stir in andouille. Simmer,
   uncovered, until gumbo thickens slightly, 20 to 25 minutes.
4. Once cool enough to handle, shred chicken into bite-size pieces. Stir
   chicken and scallions into gumbo. Remove pot from heat, stir in
   vinegar, and season with salt to taste. Discard bay leaves. Serve,
   passing hot sauce separately. (Gumbo can be refrigerated in airtight
   container for up to 3 days.)

Pesto Chicken Garlic Knot Sliders
=================================

Source: `Tasty <https://tasty.co/recipe/pesto-chicken-garlic-knot-sliders>`__

Ingredients
-----------
- 1 1/2 lb pizza dough
- 3 cups rotisserie chicken, shredded
- 8 oz pesto, 1 jar
- 2 cups (200 g) shredded mozzarella cheese
- 3 tablespoons salted butter
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped

Directions
----------

1. Cut pizza dough into eighths. (Each ball of dough should yield 8 even-sized
   pieces of dough, for a total of 16).
2. Using your hands, roll each piece of dough into a thin strip about
   7 inches (18cm) long. Then carefully tie them into a knot, tucking the
   loose ends of dough underneath.
3. Place each tied knot on a baking sheet or casserole dish with high sides,
   nestling them close together in a 4x4 in (10x10-cm) grid. Once all the
   knots are placed in the dish, cover and let rest for 10 minutes.
4. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
5. Uncover and bake for 12 minutes or until the slider buns are golden brown
   and no doughy grey bits remain.
6. Once the knots are out of the oven, lower the oven temperature to 350°F.
7. Allow the knots to cool, carefully remove them from the baking dish and
   cut the grid horizontally, creating both a top and bottom piece.
   NOTE: It’s helpful to hold the knots together with a towel on top while
   cutting them horizontally, as the motion of the knife might cause some of
   them to pull apart.
8. Return the bottom half of the knot-grid to the original baking dish. Evenly
   layer the bread with cooked chicken, followed by the pesto and mozzarella
   cheese. Place the top half of the garlic knots on top.
9. Mix together melted butter, garlic, and parsley. Brush mixture liberally
   over the top of the knots.
10. Bake at 350°F (180°C) for an additional 10 minutes until the tops of the
    knots are golden brown and cheese is melted.
11. Pull apart for individual sliders.
