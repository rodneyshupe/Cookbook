Ingredients
-----------
- 2 bay leaves
- 6 sprigs fresh thyme
- 4 sprigs fresh parsley leaves
- 1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms, rinsed in mesh strainer under running water
- 3 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 1/4 pounds cremini mushrooms, wiped clean with a paper towel, stems discarded, and caps cut into fourths if small or sixths if medium or large
- 2 medium onions, chopped fine (2 cups)
- Salt
- 3 medium cloves garlic, pressed through garlic press or minced (about 1 tablespoon)
- 1 pound Arborio rice (2 1/8 cups)
- 1 cup dry white wine or dry vermouth
- 2 ounces Parmesan cheese, finely grated (about 1 cup)
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves
- Ground black pepper

Directions
----------
1. Tie together bay leaves, thyme sprigs, and parsley sprigs with kitchen
   twine. Bring bundled herbs, porcini mushrooms, chicken broth, soy sauce,
   and 3 1/2 cups water to boil in medium saucepan over medium-high heat;
   reduce to medium-low and simmer until dried mushrooms are softened and
   fully hydrated, about 15 minutes. Remove and discard herb bundle and
   strain broth through fine-mesh strainer set over medium bowl (you should
   have about 6 1/2 cups strained liquid); return liquid to saucepan and
   keep warm over low heat. Finely mince porcini and set aside.
2. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Heat
   2 tablespoons butter in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.
   When foaming subsides, add cremini mushrooms, 1 cup onions, and
   1/2 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring occasionally, until moisture released
   by mushrooms evaporates and mushrooms are well browned, about 7 minutes.
   Stir in garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute, then transfer mushrooms
   to oven-safe bowl and keep warm in oven. Off heat, add 1/4 cup water to
   now-empty skillet and scrape with wooden spoon to loosen any browned
   bits; pour liquid from skillet into saucepan with broth.
3. Heat 3 tablespoons butter in large saucepan over medium heat. When
   foaming subsides, add remaining 1 cup onions and 1/4 teaspoon salt; cook,
   stirring occasionally, until onions are softened and translucent, about
   9 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring frequently, until grainsâ€™ edges
   are transparent, about 4 minutes. Add wine and cook, stirring frequently,
   until rice absorbs wine. Add minced porcini and 3 1/2 cups broth and cook,
   stirring every 2 to 3 minutes, until liquid is absorbed, 9 to 11 minutes.
   Stir in additional 1/2 cup broth every 2 to 3 minutes until rice is
   cooked through but grains are still somewhat firm at center,
   10 to 12 minutes (rice may not require all of broth). Stir in remaining
   1 tablespoon butter, then stir in mushrooms (and any accumulated juices),
   Parmesan, and chopped parsley. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper;
   serve immediately in warmed bowls.
