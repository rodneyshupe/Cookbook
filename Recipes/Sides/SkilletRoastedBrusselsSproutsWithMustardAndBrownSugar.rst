Yield: Serves 4

Ingredients
-----------

-  1 pound small (1 to 1 1/2 inches in diameter) Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved
-  5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
-  1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
-  1 tablespoon packed brown sugar
-  2 teaspoons white wine vinegar
-  1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
-  Salt

Directions
----------

1. Arrange Brussels sprouts in single layer, cut sides down, in 12-inch
   nonstick skillet. Drizzle oil evenly over sprouts. Cover skillet,
   place over medium-high heat, and cook until sprouts are bright green
   and cut sides have started to brown, about 5 minutes.
2. Uncover and continue to cook until cut sides of sprouts are deeply
   and evenly browned and paring knife slides in with little to no
   resistance, 2 to 3 minutes longer, adjusting heat and moving sprouts
   as necessary to prevent them from overbrowning. While sprouts cook,
   combine mustard, sugar, vinegar, cayenne, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in
   small bowl.
3. Off heat, add mustard mixture to skillet and stir to evenly coat
   sprouts. Season with salt to taste. Transfer sprouts to large plate
   and serve.
