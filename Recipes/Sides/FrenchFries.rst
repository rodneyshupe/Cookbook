French Fries
============

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 1/2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes (about 6 medium), scrubbed, dried, sides squared off, and cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch by 1/4-inch batons
-  6 cups peanut oil
-  1/4 cup bacon fat, strained (optional)
-  Kosher salt


Directions
----------

1. Combine potatoes, oil, and bacon fat (if using) in large Dutch oven.
   Cook over high heat until oil has reached rolling boil, about 5
   minutes. Continue to cook, without stirring, until potatoes are limp
   but exteriors are beginning to firm, about 15 minutes.
2. Using tongs, stir potatoes, gently scraping up any that stick, and
   continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until golden and crisp, 5 to
   10 minutes longer. Using skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer fries to
   thick paper bag or paper towels. Season with salt and serve
   immediately.


Notes
-----

Flavoring the oil with bacon fat (optional) gives the fries a mild meaty
flavor. It is best to use peanut oil for frying, but vegetable or canola
oil can be substituted.
