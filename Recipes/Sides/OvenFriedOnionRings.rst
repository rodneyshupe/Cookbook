Ingredients
-----------

-  1/2 cup all-purpose flour
-  1 large egg, at room temperature
-  1/2 cup buttermilk, at room temperature  (substitute 3/4 teaspoons of cream of tartar and 1/2 cup milk)
-  1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
-  Salt and pepper
-  30 saltines
-  4 cups kettle-cooked potato chips
-  2 large yellow onions cut into 24 large rings (see note)
-  6 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven racks to lower-middle and upper-middle positions and heat
   oven to 450Â°F. Place 1/4 cup flour in shallow baking dish. Beat egg
   and buttermilk together in medium bowl. Whisk remaining 1/4 cup
   flour, cayenne, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper into
   buttermilk mixture. Pulse saltines and chips together in food
   processor until finely ground and place in separate shallow baking
   dish.
2. Pull apart the rings in each round, discarding any that are less than
   2 inches in diameter. Working one at a time, dredge each onion ring
   in flour, shaking off excess. Dip in buttermilk mixture, allowing
   excess to drip back into bowl, then drop into crumb coating, turning
   ring to coat evenly. Transfer to large plate and repeat with
   remaining onion rings.
3. Pour 3 tablespoons oil onto each of two rimmed baking sheets. Place
   in oven and heat until just smoking, about 8 minutes. Carefully tilt
   heated sheets to coat evenly with oil, then arrange onion rings on
   sheets. Bake, flipping onion rings over and switching and rotating
   position of baking sheets halfway through baking, until golden brown
   on both sides, about 15 minutes. Transfer onion rings to plates lined
   with paper towels to drain briefly. Serve immediately.


Make Ahead
----------

Oven-Fried Onion Rings can be breaded in advance and refrigerated for up
to an hour. Let them sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before
baking; if baked straight from the fridge, the onions will not soften
properly and will remain crunchy.
