| Prep Time: 10 minutes | Cooking Time: 1 hour | Yield: 6 servings |
+-----------------------+----------------------+-------------------+

Ingredients
-----------

-  6 pickling cucumbers
-  Kosher salt, to taste
-  1 onion, cut into thin crescents
-  1 carrot, cut into thin strips
-  12 scallions, cut into thin strips
-  1/4 cup fish sauce
-  1 tablespoon sugar
-  2/3 cup gochugaru chile flakes

Directions
----------

1. Cut the cucumbers lengthwise twice, almost into quarters, leaving
   about 1/2 inch at one end to keep the pieces attached. Rub well,
   inside and out, with salt. Set aside for 20 minutes.
2. In a bowl, combine the onion, carrot, scallions, fish sauce, sugar,
   and gochugaru. Rinse off most of the salt from the cucumbers. Stuff
   each cucumber with the onion mixture and pack snugly into a
   container. Let sit for 30 minutes, or refrigerate for up to a week.
