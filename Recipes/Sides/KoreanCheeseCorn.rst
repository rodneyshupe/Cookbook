Korean cheese corn
==================

This may not sound particularly Korean, but it is a popular drinking
snack in Korea.

Serves 6


Ingredients
-----------

-  2 tablespoons mayonnaise
-  4 ears corn
-  1 tablespoon butter
-  1 clove garlic, sliced very thin
-  Salt and pepper, to taste
-  1 teaspoon sugar (if needed)
-  2 ounces shredded mozzarella


Directions
----------

1. Preheat the broiler to high. In a shallow gratin dish, spread the
   mayonnaise liberally across the bottom.
2. Cut the corn off the cobs into a bowl; use the back of the knife to
   scrape any remaining juices from the cobs.
3. In a large saut√© pan over medium heat, add the butter and garlic.
   When the butter is foamy and sizzling, add all the corn and toss.
   Cook for about 1 minute. Add salt, pepper, and sugar, if you like.
4. Spread the corn in the gratin dish. Top evenly with the cheese. (Dish
   can be prepared up to this point a day ahead.) Put gratin dish under
   the broiler for a few minutes, until the cheese is melted and
   starting to brown in a few spots. Serve immediately.
