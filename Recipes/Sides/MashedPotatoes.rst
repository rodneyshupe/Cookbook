Mashed Potatoes
===============

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes (4 to 6 medium), peeled, cut into 1-inch chunks, rinsed well, and drained (may substitute Russets or White potatoes, do not use red potatoes)
-  4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
-  Table salt
-  2/3 cup whole milk, warm
-  Ground black pepper


Directions
----------

1. Place metal colander or steamer insert in large pot or Dutch oven.
   Add enough water for it to barely reach bottom of colander. Turn heat
   to high and bring water to boil. Add potatoes, cover, and reduce heat
   to medium-high. Cook potatoes 10 minutes. Transfer colander to sink
   and rinse potatoes under cold water until no longer hot, 1 to 2
   minutes. Return colander and potatoes to pot, cover, and continue to
   cook until potatoes are soft and tip of paring knife inserted into
   potato meets no resistance, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Pour off water
   from Dutch oven.
2. Set ricer or food mill over now-empty pot. Working in batches,
   transfer potatoes to hopper of ricer or food mill and process,
   removing any potatoes stuck to bottom. Using rubber spatula, stir in
   melted butter and 1/2 teaspoon salt until incorporated. Stir in warm
   milk until incorporated. Season to taste with salt and pepper; serve
   immediately.
