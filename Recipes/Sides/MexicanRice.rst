Ingredients
-----------
- 1 1/2 cups long-grain white rice
- 1 tomato, cored and quartered
- 1 jalapeño chile, stemmed, halved, and seeded
- Salt and pepper
- 1 garlic clove, chopped
- 1 - 1 3/4 cups chicken broth
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- Lime wedges

Directions
----------
1. Place rice in fine-mesh strainer and rinse under cold running water for
   1 1/2 minutes. Shake strainer vigorously to remove all excess water; set
   aside.
2. Process tomato, jalapeño, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, garlic, and 1/4 teaspoon
   pepper in food processor until smooth, about 30 seconds, scraping down
   sides of bowl as needed. Transfer mixture to 4-cup liquid measuring cup.
   Stir to deflate foam, if necessary, then add enough broth to equal
   2 1/2 cups.
3. Heat oil in large saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add
   rice and cook, stirring frequently, until edges begin to turn translucent,
   about 2 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until
   mixture is uniformly colored, about 1 minute. Add tomato mixture and bring
   to boil. Stir rice, cover, and reduce heat to low. Cook for 20 minutes.
4. Let stand, covered, off heat for 10 minutes. Stir in cilantro and season
   with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer rice to serving bowl. Serve with
   lime wedges.
