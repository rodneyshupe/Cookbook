Roasted Potatoes
================


Ingredients
-----------

-  3lb. White potatoes, peeled
-  Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
-  Olive oil
-  1 bulb of garlic, broken into cloves
-  Red wine vinegar

Flavor Combo1
-------------

-  A good couple of lugs of olive oil
-  A bunch of fresh rosemary, leaves picked

Flavor Combo 2
--------------

-  50g butter, cut into little cubes
-  A bunch of fresh sage, roughly torn
-  1 clementine

Flavor Combo 3
--------------

-  2 tablespoons goose fat
-  A bunch of fresh thyme, leaves picked
-  A couple of fresh bay leaves


Directions
----------

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F. Peel your potatoes with a knife or speed
   peeler and cut any larger ones so they’re all an even-size - twice
   the size of a squash ball is about right. Wash your potatoes in cold
   water to get rid of any extra starch then tip into a large pot, cover
   with cold water and season well. Bring to the boil and cook for about
   6 to 7 minutes, so that they’re parboiled, then drain in a colander
   and leave to steam dry for 3 minutes. Give the colander a bit of a
   shake to help chuff up the potatoes - this will help to make them
   super crisp later on.
2. At this point, you need to decide which flavour combo to go with. Tip
   your potatoes into a tray or pan in one layer, and add your fat -
   olive oil, butter or goose fat - then season really well with salt
   and pepper. At this stage, I’m not going to add any more flavour.
   Toss your potatoes in the fat, or use a spoon or fish slice to mix it
   all up. You could get the potatoes up to this stage the day before,
   simply cover them with cling film or tin foil and pop in the bottom
   of your fridge or in a cool place until you need them. Put your
   potatoes in the hot oven to cook for 30 minutes until lightly golden
   and three quarters cooked.
3. Now’s the time for my new trick. Gently squash each potato with a
   potato masher to increase the surface area - the more of your potato
   that’s in contact with the pan, the crispier it will be. Whichever
   fat you’re using, you now want to prepare the rest of the
   flavourings. Add a good lug of olive oil to a small bowl and add the
   herbs, garlic and a splash of red wine vinegar, then scrunch and mix
   it up a bit. If you’re using butter, peel in a good few strips of
   clementine zest with a speed peeler - you won’t eat these but they’ll
   add amazing flavour. Add the flavour to your potatoes and give the
   pan a good shake, then pop back in the hot oven for 40 to 45 minutes
   until perfect for your liking. You’re looking for gnarly, crispy,
   bubbly and delicious.
4. Transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain off some of the
   excess fat, then tuck in! I’d be happy with any of these flavour
   combos, but this year I’ll be going for butter, but maybe with the
   rosemary and garlic. So you really can mix it up however you like.
