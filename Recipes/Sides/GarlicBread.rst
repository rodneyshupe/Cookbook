Garlic Bread
============

Ingredients
-----------
- 9 - 10 medium cloves garlic (about the size of a plump cashew nut), skins left on
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/2 teaspoon table salt
- 1 loaf Italian bread (high-quality); about 1 pound, football-shaped), halved lengthwise

Directions
----------
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 500Â°F. Meanwhile,
   toast garlic cloves in small skillet over medium heat, shaking pan
   occasionally, until fragrant and color of cloves deepens slightly, about
   8 minutes. When cool enough to handle, skin and mince cloves (you should
   have about 3 tablespoons). Using dinner fork, mash garlic, butter, cheese,
   and salt in small bowl until thoroughly combined.
2. Spread cut sides of loaf evenly with garlic butter mixture; season to taste
   with pepper. Transfer loaf halves, buttered side up, onto baking sheet;
   bake, reversing position of baking sheet in oven from front to back halfway
   through baking time, until surface of bread is golden brown and toasted,
   8 to 10 minutes. Cut each half into 2-inch slices; serve immediately.

Note
----
Garlic bread is best served piping hot, so time it to arrive at the table last,
once all the other dishes are finished and ready to serve.
