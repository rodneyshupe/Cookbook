================================

Source: `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/7535-pressure-cooker-parmesan-risotto>`__

Ingredients
-----------
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 small onion, chopped fine
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 1/2 cups Arborio rice
- 1/2 cup white wine
- 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth, warmed
- 1 ounce Parmesan cheese, grated (1/2 cup), plus extra for serving
- Salt and pepper

Directions
----------
1. BUILD FLAVOR: Melt butter in pressure-cooker pot over medium-high heat.
   Add onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and
   cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in rice and toast lightly,
   about 3 minutes. Stir in wine and cook until almost evaporated, about
   1 minute. Stir in 3 1/4 cups broth. Using wooden spoon, scrape up any
   rice sticking to bottom of pot.
2. HIGH PRESSURE FOR 6 MINUTES: Lock pressure-cooker lid in place and bring
   to high pressure over medium-high heat. As soon as pot reaches high
   pressure, reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 6 minutes, adjusting
   heat as needed to maintain high pressure.
3. QUICK RELEASE PRESSURE: Remove pot from heat. Quick release pressure,
   then carefully remove lid, allowing steam to escape away from you.
4. BEFORE SERVING: Continue to cook risotto over medium heat, stirring
   constantly, until rice is tender and liquid has thickened, about
   6 minutes. Stir in Parmesan and season with salt and pep- per to taste.
   Before serving, add remaining 3/4 cup broth as needed to loosen risotto
   consistency.
