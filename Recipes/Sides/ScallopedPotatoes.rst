==================

Source: `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/36-scalloped-potatoes>`__

Serves: 4 to 6


Ingredients
-----------

-  2 tablespoons unsalted butter
-  1 medium onion, minced (about 1 cup)
-  2 medium cloves garlic, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)
-  1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme leaves
-  1 1/4 teaspoons table salt
-  1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
-  2 1/2 pounds russet potatoes (about 5 medium), peeled and sliced 1/8-inch thick (see photos below)
-  1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
-  1 cup heavy cream
-  2 bay leaves
-  4 ounces grated cheddar cheese, shredded (1 cup)


Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position; heat oven to 425°F.
2. Melt butter in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until foaming
   subsides. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and
   lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Add garlic, thyme, salt, and
   pepper; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add potatoes, chicken
   broth, cream, and bay leaves and bring to simmer. Cover, reduce heat
   to medium-low, and simmer until potatoes are almost tender (paring
   knife can be slipped into and out of potato slice with some
   resistance), about 10 minutes. Discard bay leaves.
3. Transfer mixture to 8-inch-square baking dish (or other 1 1/2-quart
   gratin dish) and press to an even layer; sprinkle evenly with cheese.
   Bake until cream is bubbling around edges and top is golden brown,
   about 15 minutes. Cool 10 minutes before serving.


Make Ahead
----------

Once the scalloped potatoes have been transferred to the baking dish and
pressed into an even layer in step 3, they can be wrapped in plastic
wrap and refrigerated for up to 24 hours. When ready to bake, add the
cheese, cover with foil, and bake in a 400°F oven until the mixture is
hot and bubbling, about 45 minutes. Remove the foil and cook until the
cheddar begins to brown, about 30 minutes longer. Let cool for 10
minutes before serving.
