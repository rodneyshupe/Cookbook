-  6 medium beats
-  2 1/2 pounds carrots, cut diagonally into 3/4 inch thick slices
-  2 tablespoons olive oil
-  Coarse (kosher or sea) salt and freshly ground black pepper


Directions
----------
1. Preheat oven to 425Â°F. Wrap beets tightly in foil making 2 packages
   and roast in middle of oven until tender, about 1 1/4 hours.
2. Toss carrots with oil and salt and pepper to taste in a shallow
   baking pan.
3. Remove beets from oven and roast carrots in middle of oven until
   tender, about 20 minutes.
4. While carrots are roasting, unwrap beets, and when just cool enough
   to handle, slip off skins and remove stems. Cut each beet into 6
   wedges.
5. Add beets to carrots, tossing to combine and roast until beets are
   hot and carrots are very tender, about 15 minutes more.
