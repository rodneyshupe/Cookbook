Classic Risotto
===============

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
-  1 onion, chopped
-  4 clove garlic, minced
-  2 cup Arborio rice
-  1 cup Italian white wine
-  8 cup real chicken broth, simmering hot
-  1 cup good quality Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, shredded
-  1 Tbsp (or so) of butter
-  a few sprigs of fresh thyme or any fresh herb, minced

Directions
----------

1. Lightly simmer the chicken broth in one pot as you make the risotto
   in another pot.
2. Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, then add in the
   onions and garlic. Saute until golden and fragrant, a few minutes.
   Add the rice and continue to cook and stir over medium high heat,
   coating the grains evenly with the oil, until the rice grains give
   off a toasty aroma and transform from pure white to almost entirely
   opaque.
3. Add in the white wine and stir frequently as the rice absorbs the
   liquid. Reduce your heat to low. Start adding the hot chicken stock
   in several additions, stirring frequently after each one and allowing
   the rice to absorb the broth. Continue to cook and stir the risotto
   until the rice is just tender or al dente (soft with an ever so
   slight bite to the center) and creamy. The Arborio rice will
   gradually release its starch and thicken the extra liquid into
   creaminess. Creamy is important if youâ€™re going for authenticity!
   This will take about 20 minutes from when you start adding the
   liquid.
4. To finish stir in the Parmesan, butter and minced fresh herbs. Spoon
   into dishes piping hot and share.

Variations
----------

1. Cook 1 diced chorizo before step 2 in the pan. Remove choizo and set
   aside. In step 2 use rendered fat in place of some of the olive oil.
   Re-add chorico when adding last batch of liquid in step 3. Add 1 cup
   of cooked peas in step 4 instead of herbs.
2. Add chopped meat from 1 lobster tail to risotto mixture in step 3
   half way through adding the liquids.
