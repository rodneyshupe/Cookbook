Cuban Black Beans
=================

Ingredients
-----------

-  1 pound dried black beans picked over and rinsed
-  1 green bell pepper quartered lengthwise
-  2 Bay Leaves
-  1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil
-  1 red, 1 green and 1 yellow pepper minced
-  1 large white onion minced
-  1 tablespoon ground cumin
-  1 tablespoon oregano
-  1/2 cup minced garlic
-  1/4 cup tomato paste
-  Salt


Directions
----------

1. Put the black beans, quartered green pepper and bay leaves in a large
   saucepan add 8 cups of water. Bring to a boil over moderately high
   heat. Reduce the heat to low, partially cover the saucepan and cook,
   stirring occasionally, until the beans are tender, about 2 1/2 hours.
   Remove and discard the green pieces and bay leaves.
2. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet.
   Add the minced bell peppers and onion and cook over moderate heat
   until softened. Stir in the cumin and oregano. In a small saucepan,
   cook the garlic in the remaining 1/2 cup of olive oil over moderately
   low heat until golden brown.
3. When the beans are tender, add the sauteed pepper mixture, the garlic
   in its oil and the tomato paste. Season with salt and simmer gently
   for 5 minutes to blend the flavours. Cover and refrigerate overnight
   or for up to 3 days. Reheat gently before serving.
