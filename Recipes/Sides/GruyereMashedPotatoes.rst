Gruyere Mashed Potatoes
=======================

Ingredients
-----------

- 1.25kg yellow potatoes, peeled and quartered
- 4 garlic cloves
- 4 thyme sprigs
- Kosher salt
- 6 tablespoons butter
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1/4 cup milk
- 200g Gruyere cheese, grated
- 100g mozzarella cheese, grated


Directions
----------

1. Place the potatoes into a pot and cover with cold water. Add in the
   garlic and thyme, generously season with salt, and bring to a boil over
   medium-high heat. Cook the potatoes until fork tender, about
   15 to 20 minutes. Drain, discard the thyme, and return the potatoes and
   garlic to the pot.
2. Roughly mash the potatoes and garlic with a masher and add in the butter,
   cream, and buttermilk. Using a hand mixer, beat the potatoes until smooth
   and creamy. Switch to a heat-proof spatula or wooden spoon and gradually
   stir in the grated cheese, adding a handful at a time. Season the
   potatoes with salt to taste and, if needed, add more cream or buttermilk
   until the potatoes reach your desired consistency.
