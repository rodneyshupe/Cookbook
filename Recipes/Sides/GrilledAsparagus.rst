Ingredients
-----------

-  1 pound asparagus (the stalks shouldnâ€™t be too thin)
-  2 tablespoons Asian (dark) sesame oil
-  1 tablespoon soy sauce
-  1 clove garlic, minced
-  Coarse (kosher or sea) salt and freshly ground black pepper
-  2 tablespoons sesame seeds


Directions
----------
1. Set up the grill for direct grilling and preheat to high.
2. Snap off the woody bases of the asparagus and discard. Trim the ends
   with a knife so the stalks are a uniform length. Skewer 4 or 5
   asparagus spears together, using toothpicks or bamboo skewers. (Think
   of a Huck Finn-type raft!)
3. In a small bowl, combine the sesame oil, soy sauce, and garlic and
   stir with a fork to mix. Brush this mixture on the asparagus rafts on
   both sides. Season the rafts with a little salt and lots of pepper.
4. When ready to cook, place the rafts on the hot grate and grill until
   nicely browned on both sides, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Sprinkle the
   asparagus rafts with the sesame seeds as they grill. You can serve
   the asparagus as rafts, or unskewered.
