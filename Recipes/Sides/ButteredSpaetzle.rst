Buttered Spaetzle
=================

Yield: Serves 4

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 large eggs, beaten
-  1/3 cup milk or water
-  1/2 teaspoon table salt
-  1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
-  1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
-  1 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
-  1 tablespoon + 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into 6 pieces

Directions
----------

1. Beat eggs, milk, and seasonings in a medium bowl. Stir in flour to
   form a smooth but thick batter; let batter rest for 10 minutes.
2. Meanwhile place 1 tablespoon butter into a bowl that has been rinsed
   in hot water and dried. Heat water to boil medium pot small enough so that
   the short ends of the spaetzle maker (or a large holed sieve or metal
   grater) can rest on its rim.
3. Salt boiling water, then spoon a portion of the batter into the the
   square container that runs along the grater track. With the machine
   resting on the pan rim, move the metal container quickly back and
   forth along the grater until about 1/6 of the dough is pressed
   through the grater into the boiling water.
4. With a slotted spoon transfer spaetzle that have floated to the
   waterâ€™s surface to the warm bowl. Repeat cooking in batches with
   remaining batter, adding butter to each batch of cooked spaeztle.
   Toss and serve.
