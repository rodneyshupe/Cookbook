Potato Latkes
=============

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 pounds russet potatoes, unpeeled, scrubbed, and shredded
-  1/2 cup grated onion
-  Salt and pepper
-  2 large eggs, lightly beaten
-  2 teaspoons minced fresh parsley
-  Vegetable oil

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position, place rimmed baking sheet on
   rack, and heat oven to 200°F. Toss potatoes, onion, and 1
   teaspoon salt in bowl. Place half of potato mixture in center of dish
   towel. Gather ends together and twist tightly to drain as much liquid
   as possible, reserving liquid in liquid measuring cup. Transfer
   drained potato mixture to second bowl and repeat process with
   remaining potato mixture. Set potato liquid aside and let stand so
   starch settles to bottom, at least 5 minutes.
2. Cover potato mixture and microwave until just warmed through but not
   hot, 1 to 2 minutes, stirring mixture with fork every 30 seconds.
   Spread potato mixture evenly over second rimmed baking sheet and let
   cool for 10 minutes. Don’t wash out bowl.
3. Pour off water from reserved potato liquid, leaving potato starch in
   measuring cup. Add eggs and stir until smooth. Return cooled potato
   mixture to bowl. Add parsley, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and potato starch
   mixture and toss until evenly combined.
4. Set wire rack in clean rimmed baking sheet and line with triple layer
   of paper towels. Heat 1/4-inch depth of oil in 12-inch skillet over
   medium-high heat until shimmering but not smoking (350°F).
   Place 1/4-cup mound of potato mixture in oil and press with nonstick
   spatula into 1/3-inch-thick disk. Repeat until 5 latkes are in pan.
   Cook, adjusting heat so fat bubbles around latke edges, until golden
   brown on bottom, about 3 minutes. Turn and continue cooking until
   golden brown on second side, about 3 minutes longer. Drain on paper
   towels and transfer to baking sheet in oven. Repeat with remaining
   potato mixture, adding oil to maintain 1/4-inch depth and returning
   oil to 350°F between batches. Season with salt and pepper to
   taste, and serve immediately.

Make Ahead
----------

Cooled latkes can be covered loosely with plastic wrap and held at room
temperature for up to 4 hours. Alternatively, they can be frozen on
baking sheet until firm, transferred to zipper-lock bag, and frozen for
up to 1 month. Reheat latkes in 375-degree oven until crisp and hot, 3
minutes per side for room-temperature latkes and 6 minutes per side for
frozen latkes.

   ### Potato Latkes
   ===

   #### Ingredients

   * 1 pound potatoes
   * 1/2 cup finely chopped onion
   * 1 large egg, lightly beaten
   * 1/2 teaspoon salt
   * 1/2 to 3/4 cup olive oil

   #### Directions

   1.  Preheat oven to 250&deg;F.
   2.  Peel potatoes and coarsely grate by hand, transferring to a large
       bowl of cold water as grated. Soak potatoes 1 to 2 minutes after
       last batch is added to water, then drain well in a colander.
   3.  Spread grated potatoes and onion on a kitchen towel and roll up
       jelly-roll style. Twist towel tightly to wring out as much liquid as
       possible. Transfer potato mixture to a bowl and stir in egg and
       salt.
   4.  Heat 1/4 cup oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high
       heat until hot but not smoking. Working in batches of 4 latkes,
       spoon 2 tablespoons potato mixture per latke into skillet, spreading
       into 3-inch rounds with a fork. Reduce heat to moderate and cook
       until undersides are browned, about 5 minutes. Turn latkes over and
       cook until undersides are browned, about 5 minutes more. Transfer to
       paper towels to drain and season with salt. Add more oil to skillet
       as needed. Keep latkes warm on a wire rack set in a shallow baking
       pan in oven.
