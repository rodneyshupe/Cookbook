Barbecued Baked Beans
=====================

Ingredients
-----------

-  4 ounces bacon (4 slices), chopped fine
-  1 onion, minced
-  4 cloves garlic, minced
-  1 pound dried small white beans (2 cups), rinsed and picked over
-  8 cups water
-  1 cup strong coffee (black)
-  1/2 cup barbecue sauce, plus extra for seasoning
-  1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar
-  4 1/2 teaspoons brown mustard (prepared)
-  1 tablespoon mild molasses
-  Tabasco sauce (or something similar)


Directions
----------

1. Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and heat the oven to
   300Â°F. Cook the bacon in a large Dutch oven over medium heat until
   beginning to crisp, about 5 minutes. Stir in the onion and cook until
   the onion is softened, about 5 minutes.
2. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Stir in
   the beans, water, coffee, barbecue sauce, brown sugar, mustard,
   molasses, 1/2 teaspoon Tabasco, and 1 1/4 teaspoons salt. Bring to a
   boil, scraping up any browned bits. Cover and transfer to the oven.
   Bake, stirring every hour, until the beans are tender, about 4 hours.
3. Remove the lid and continue to bake, uncovered, until the liquid has
   thickened to a syrupy consistency, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Season the beans
   with additional barbecue sauce, Tabasco, and salt and pepper to
   taste.


Make-a-head
-----------

After cooking, the beans can be cooled to room temperature and
refrigerated, wrapping tightly in plastic wrap, for up to 4 days. Reheat
over medium-low heat before serving.
