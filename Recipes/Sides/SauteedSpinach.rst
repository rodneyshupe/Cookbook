Ingredients
-----------

- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
- 1/2 shallot, finely chopped, optional
- 2 cloves garlic, finely minced (or 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder)
- 10 to 12 ounces baby spinach leaves (~8 cups)
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (or more to taste)
- 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper (or more to taste)

Directions
----------

1. In a large, wide pot or Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium-high flame
   and sauté the optional chopped shallot until soft, about three minutes.
   Add the garlic for the last minute (so it becomes fragrant and slightly
   browned, but doesn’t burn).
2. Add as much of the spinach that will fit in the pot and occasionally toss
   with tongs. As it wilts down, keep adding more until the entire bag is
   used up. This should take about two minutes.
3. Turn the heat to high, and cook the spinach for another minute or so,
   stirring continuously, until the spinach is wilted and well sautéed. Mix
   in the salt and pepper.
4. Taste, and season with additional salt and pepper as needed. You can also
   add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to brighten it up (start with one
   tablespoon and increase from there) and some crushed red pepper flakes
   for heat.
