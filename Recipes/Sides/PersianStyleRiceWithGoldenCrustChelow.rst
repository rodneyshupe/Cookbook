=============================================

*Chelow* is a classic Iranian dish that marries an unusually light and
fluffy rice pilaf with a golden-brown, crispy crust (which is known as
tahdig). It is, in essence, two dishes in one.

Ingredients
-----------
-  2 cups basmati rice
-  Salt
-  1 tablespoon plus 1/4 cup vegetable oil
-  1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt
-  1 1/2 teaspoons cumin seeds
-  2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 8 cubes
-  1/4 cup minced fresh flat leaf parsley


Directions
----------
1. Place rice in fine-mesh strainer and rinse under cold running water
   until water runs clear. Place rinsed rice and 1 tablespoon salt in
   medium bowl and cover with 4 cups hot tap water. Stir gently to
   dissolve salt; let stand for 15 minutes. Drain rice in fine-mesh
   strainer.
2. Meanwhile, bring 8 cups water to boil in Dutch oven over high heat.
   Add rice and 2 tablespoons salt. Boil briskly, stirring frequently,
   until rice is mostly tender with slight bite in center and grains are
   floating toward top of pot, 3 to 5 minutes (begin timing from when
   rice is added to pot).
3. Drain rice in large fine-mesh strainer and rinse with cold water to
   stop cooking, about 30 seconds. Rinse and dry pot well to remove any
   residual starch. Brush bottom and 1 inch up sides of pot with 1
   tablespoon oil.
4. Whisk remaining 1/4 cup oil, yogurt, 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, and 1/4
   teaspoon salt together in medium bowl. Add 2 cups parcooked rice and
   stir until combined. Spread yogurt-rice mixture evenly over bottom of
   prepared pot, packing it down well.
5. Stir remaining 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds into remaining rice. Mound
   rice in center of pot on top of yogurt-rice base (it should look like
   small hill). Poke 8 equally spaced holes through rice mound but not
   into yogurt-rice base. Place 1 butter cube in each hole. Drizzle 1/3
   cup water over rice mound.
6. Wrap pot lid with clean dish towel and cover pot tightly, making sure
   towel is secure on top of lid and away from heat. Cook over
   medium-high heat until rice on bottom is crackling and steam is
   coming from sides of pot, about 10 minutes, rotating pot halfway
   through for even cooking.
7. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook until rice is tender
   and fluffy and crust is golden brown around edges, 30 to 35 minutes
   longer. Remove covered pot from heat and place on damp dish towel set
   in rimmed baking sheet; let stand for 5 minutes.
8. Stir 2 tablespoons parsley into rice, making sure not to disturb
   crust on bottom of pot, and season with salt to taste. Gently spoon
   rice onto serving platter.
9. Using thin metal spatula, loosen edges of crust from pot, then break
   crust into large pieces. Transfer pieces to serving platter,
   arranging evenly around rice. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons
   parsley and serve.
