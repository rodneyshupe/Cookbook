Green Beans with Sauteed Shallots and Vermouth
==============================================

Yield: Serves 4 to 6


Ingredients
-----------

-  1 teaspoon table salt
-  1 pound green beans, stem ends snapped off
-  4 tablespoons unsalted butter
-  4 large shallots, sliced thin (about 2 cups)
-  Salt and ground black pepper
-  2 tablespoons dry vermouth


Directions
----------

1. Bring 2 1/2 quarts water to boil in large saucepan over high heat;
   add salt and green beans, return to boil, and cook until beans are
   bright green and crisp-tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Meanwhile, fill large
   bowl with ice water. Drain beans in colander and transfer beans
   immediately to ice water. When beans no longer feel warm to touch,
   drain in colander again and dry thoroughly with paper towels.
2. Heat 2 tablespoons butter in small skillet over medium heat until
   foaming; add shallots and cook, stirring frequently, until golden
   brown, fragrant, and just crisp around the edges, about 10 minutes.
   Set skillet aside.
3. Heat 1/4 cup water and beans in 12-inch skillet over high heat; cook,
   tossing frequently, until beans are warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes.
   Season with salt and pepper to taste and arrange neatly on warm
   serving platter.
4. Meanwhile, return skillet with shallots to high heat, stir in
   vermouth, and bring to simmer. Whisk in remaining 2 tablespoons
   butter, 1 tablespoon at a time; season with salt and pepper to taste.
   Top beans with shallots and sauce and serve immediately.
