1. Place rice in fine-mesh strainer and rinse under cold running water
   until water runs clear. Drain well. Melt butter in medium saucepan over
   medium-high heat. Add rice and cook, stirring constantly, until grains
   become chalky and opaque, 1 to 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring
   constantly, about 30 seconds. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring
   constantly, until tomato paste is evenly distributed, about 1 minute.

   minutes. Let stand off heat, covered, for 10 minutes. Fluff rice with
   fork and stir to combine. Serve.
