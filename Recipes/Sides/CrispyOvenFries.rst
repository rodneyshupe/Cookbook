Ingredients
-----------

-  4 russet potatoes (6 to 8 ounces each), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch-thick fries
-  6 tablespoons vegetable oil
-  1 tablespoon cornstarch
-  1 teaspoon salt


Directions
----------

1. *Microwave Potatoes* Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat
   oven to 450Â°F. Place potatoes in bowl, wrap tightly with plastic, and
   microwave until translucent around edges, 3 to 5 minutes, shaking
   bowl to redistribute potatoes halfway through cooking. Transfer
   potatoes to cooling rack and thoroughly blot dry with paper towels.
2. *Heat Oil* Coat rimmed baking sheet with 5 tablespoons oil. Transfer
   to oven and heat until just smoking, 5 to 7 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk
   remaining oil, cornstarch, and salt in large bowl. Add potatoes to
   bowl and toss to coat.
3. *Bake Potatoes* Arrange in a single layer on hot baking sheet and
   bake until deep golden brown and crisp, 25 to 35 minutes, flipping
   potatoes half-way through cooking time. Transfer to paper towel-lined
   plate and blot with additional paper towels. Serve.
