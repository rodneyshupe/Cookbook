Indoor Clam Bake
================

+-----------------------+--------------------------+---------------------+
| Prep Time: 15 minutes | Cooking Time: 20 minutes | Yield: 4-6 servings |
+-----------------------+--------------------------+---------------------+

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 pounds (900g) live spot prawns or 2 dungeness crabs (1 pound each) (or 1 two pound)
-  2 pounds (900g) small littleneck or cherry stone clams, scrubbed
-  2 pounds (900g) mussels, scrubbed and beards removed
-  1 pound (450g) chorizo or kielbasa, sliced into 1/2 inch-thick rounds
-  1 pound (450g) small new or red potatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces
-  4 medium ears corn, silk and all but the last layer of husk removed
-  8 tablespoons (1 stick) salted butter, melted

Directions
----------

1. Place clams and mussels on large piece of cheesecloth and tie ends
   together to secure; set aside. In heavy-bottomed 12-quart stockpot,
   layer sliced kielbasa, sack of clams-mussels, potatoes, corn, and
   prawns and crab on top of one another. Cover with lid and place over
   high heat. Cook until potatoes are tender (paring knife can be
   slipped into and out of potato centers with little resistance), and
   crabs are bright red, 17 to 20 minutes.
2. Remove pot from heat and remove lid (watch out for scalding steam).
   Remove prawns and crab and set aside until cool enough to handle.
   Remove corn from pot and peel off husks; arrange ears on large
   platter. Using slotted spoon, remove potatoes and arrange them on
   platter with corn. Transfer clams and mussels to large bowl and cut
   open cheesecloth with scissors. Using slotted spoon, remove kielbasa
   from pot and arrange on platter with potatoes and corn. Pour
   remaining steaming liquid in pot over clams and mussels. Arrange crab
   parts and prawns on platter. Serve immediately with melted butter.

Variation
---------

Substitute spot prawns and crab with 2 live lobsters (about 1 1/2 pounds
each). Freeze lobsters for 10 to 15 minutes to sedate them (do not over
freeze), before killing. Once cooked, using a kitchen towel to protect
your hand, twist and remove lobster tails, claws, and legs (if desired).

Notes
-----

-  Choose a large, narrow stockpot in which you can easily layer the
   ingredients. The recipe can be cut in half and layered in an 8-quart
   Dutch oven, but it should cook for the same amount of time.

   in half lengthwise, according to illustrations below, removing stomach
   sac and intestinal tract. Scoop out green tomalley and place in medium
   bowl. Using back of chef's knife, whack one side of each claw, just to
   make opening (this will help accelerate cooking). Add breadcrumbs,
   parsley, and 2 tablespoons of melted garlic butter to bowl with
   tomalley. Use fork to mix together, breaking up tomalley at same time.
   Season lightly with salt and pepper to taste.
3. Season tail meat with salt and pepper to taste. Brush cut side of
   lobster halves with some of remaining garlic butter. Take lobsters to
   grill on large tray. Lightly dip small wad of paper towels in vegetable
   oil; holding wad with long-handled tongs, wipe cooking grate.
4. Place lobsters on grill flesh side down. Grill, with lid down, for
   2 minutes. Transfer lobsters to tray, turning them shell side down.
   Spoon tomalley mixture evenly into open cavities of all four lobster
   halves. Place lobsters back onto grill, shell-side down. Baste lobsters
   with remaining garlic butter. Grill, covered, until tail meat turns
   opaque creamy white color and tomalley mixture is bubbly and has begun
   to brown on top, 5 to 7 minutes.
5. Serve lobsters immediately with lemon wedges. Use lobster picks to get
   meat from inside claws and knuckles.

Variations
----------

  tarragon to garlic butter. Replace parsley in breadcrumb mixture with

  pepper to garlic butter. Serve lobsters with lime wedges rather than lemon
  wedges.

* In step 2, while splitting the lobsters place 2 whole lemons and 2 whole
  limes on grill to heat up. Then instead of garlic add 3 tablespoons each
  of gin and tonic to butter. Skip combining Add breadcrumbs, parsley, butter
  and tomalley. Instead inject butter mixture into the lemons and limes.
* In step 3, brush lobster with olive oil.
* In step 4, instead of basing in butter, breadcrumbs and tomalley mixture,

Lingcod Cheeks with Asparagus, Chickpeas, and Kale Chips
========================================================

Ingredients
-----------
- 1 head of Kale
- 1 cup diced asparagus
- 1 cup chickpeas
- 1/2 cup quartered red radishes
- 1 tablespoon diced shallots
- 2-3 cheeks per person
- olive oil
- butter (optional)

Directions
----------
1. Pre-heat your oven to 300 degrees F. Tear the kale into bite size pieces,
   toss in olive oil, season with sea salt and cracked pepper. Place on a
   baking sheet and bake in the oven until light golden brown and crispy.
2. In a medium-sized fry pan, sauté the shallots, chickpeas, diced asparagus
   and radishes together for a few minutes, until tender but with no extra
   colour.
3. Season the Lingcod cheeks with sea salt and cracked pepper.
4. In a pan over high heat, sauté the cheeks in olive oil for 1 minute per
   side. A little butter thrown in with the oil adds an extra hit of richness
   to the cheeks. Gives the cheeks a little napping (spooning the oil/ butter
   over the fish) while they rest in the pan for a few seconds.
5. Place the veggies on a plate or platter, lay the cheeks on top and arrange
   the kale chips around.
