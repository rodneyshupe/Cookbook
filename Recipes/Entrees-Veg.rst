Source: `Cooks Country <https://www.cookscountry.com/recipes/4480-baked-gnocchi-with-tomato-and-basil>`__

Ingredients
-----------
- 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 1 pound (450g) vacuum-packet gnocchi (see note)
- 1 onion, chopped fine
- 6 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1 can crushed tomatoes, 28 ounce (828ml)
- 1 cup water
- 1/2 cup chopped fresh basil
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 475 degrees.
   Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large ovensafe nonstick skillet over medium-high
   heat until shimmering. Cook gnocchi, stirring occasionally, until lightly
   browned, about 4 minutes; transfer to plate.
2. Add remaining oil and onion to empty skillet and cook until onion is

   stirring occasionally, until gnocchi is tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Sprinkle
   with mozzarella and bake until cheese is well browned, about 8 minutes.
   Serve.

Note
----
If you do not have an ovensafe skillet, in step 3 transfer the gnocchi to a
casserole dish for baking.

================

| Prep: 5 minutes | Total: 30 minutes | Yield: 3 |

Insanely delicious, 30-minute red lentil curry! Saucy, hearty, and protein-
rich. Perfect over brown rice for a simple, plant-based meal.

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 Tbsp coconut oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced (3 cloves yield ~1 1/2 Tbsp)
- 1 tsp minced ginger
- 1/2 cup diced carrots
- 3 Tbsp red curry paste
- 1 6-ounce can tomato paste (a 6-ounce can yields ~1/2 cup)
- 2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth (DIY or store-bought)
- 1 cup water
- 2/3 cup dry red lentils (thoroughly rinsed in cold water + drained)
- 1-2 Tbsp coconut sugar (or maple syrup)
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric (plus more to taste)
- 1/3 cup light coconut milk (optional)
- Cooked brown rice (I love this method)
- Pita or naan (omit if gluten free / check for vegan friendliness)
- Pickled red onion*
- Fresh chopped cilantro

Directions
----------

1. Thoroughly rinse lentils in a fine mesh strainer and set aside. If
   serving with brown rice, cook at this time using this method from
   Saveur.
2. Heat a large rimmed skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add coconut oil,
   garlic, ginger, and carrots. Sauté for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
3. Add curry paste and sauté for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
4. Add tomato paste, vegetable broth, water and stir to combine. Then add
   lentils, coconut sugar, turmeric, and stir.
5. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce heat slightly to low (or
   medium-low), and gently simmer for 20 minutes, or until lentils are
   tender. Stir frequently to incorporate flavors, and add more vegetable
   broth as needed if the mixture becomes too thick.
6. An optional (but recommended) step: stir in coconut milk for additional
   creaminess, and to balance the heat of the curry paste.
7. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more turmeric for depth of
   flavor, coconut sugar for sweetness/flavor balance, or a pinch of salt
   for saltiness.
8. To serve, divide brown rice (optional) and lentils between 2-3 (amount
   as original recipe is written / adjust if altering batch size) serving
   bowls and garnish with cilantro, pickled onions, and pita or naan for
   dipping (optional).
9. Store leftovers separately in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Reheat
   on the stovetop, adding water as needed for moisture, or in the
   microwave.

Red Lentil and Chickpea Curry
=============================

Source: `Vibrant Beat <https://www.vibrantbeat.com/red-lentil-and-chickpea-curry/>`__

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 cup uncooked red lentils (or 1 3/4 cup cooked, can be bought canned)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 medium sweet onion, diced (I like red, but can use yellow or white)
- 3-4 medium garlic cloves, minced
- 2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger (can buy this fresh or often can be found in squeeze tubes or bottles in the produce section)
- 2 tablespoons red curry paste (can find this in the ethnic food aisle)
- 1 tablespoon curry powder
- 1/2 teaspoon ground tumeric
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- 1 teaspoon sugar (optional, can also use honey, agave, maple syrup)
- 1 1/2 cups crushed tomatoes (I like POM brand in a box)
- 1 14 ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed (I usually rinse these in a small colander)
- Cooked grain (quinoa, farro, black rice, brown rice) or cauliflower rice
- Chopped fresh cilantro for garnish
- **Optional 2 cups fresh baby spinach leaves, sweet potato (orange or purple, cut into squares, and roasted for 30 minutes in oven)**


Directions
----------

1. Rinse lentils, place in a small to medium saucepan, cover with 2.5-3 cups
   of water. Bring to boil over medium to high heat, then reduce heat to low
   to medium, cover, and simmer for 10-15 minutes until tender. Drain excess
   water.
2. If adding sweet potato, cut into bite size squares and cook on baking
   sheet with nonstick foil or parchment paper at 350 degrees for 25 minutes.
3. In a large skillet, heat oil over medium heat (you can omit oil and saute
   in nonstick pan, adding water if needed to prevent sticking), add onion
   and saute 3-5 minutes until soft and translucent. Add garlic and cook for
   1 minute, then add ginger and cook another 1-2 minutes, stirring
   frequently to prevent small pieces from burning.
4. Stir in curry paste, curry powder, turmeric, cumin, salt, and sugar (I
   get these ready in a small dish at the start so they are easy to add).
   Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently for 1-2 minutes.
5. Stir in tomatoes, chickpeas, and cooked red lentils. Reduce heat and
   simmer until heated through.
6. Add sweet potatoes and 2 cups of spinach if using. Mix in until spinach
   is wilted.
7. Serve over a grain or cauliflower rice and top with cilantro.
