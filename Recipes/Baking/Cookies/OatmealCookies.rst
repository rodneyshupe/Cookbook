Ingredients
-----------

-  1 cup (5 ounces) all-purpose flour
-  1/4 teaspoon salt
-  1/2 teaspoon baking soda
-  4 tablespoons unsalted butter
-  1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
-  3/4 cup (5 1/4 ounces) dark brown sugar
-  1/2 cup (3 1/2 ounces) granulated sugar
-  1/2 cup Vegetable oil
-  1 large egg plus 1 large yolk
-  1 teaspoon vanilla extract
-  3 cups (9 ounces) old-fashioned rolled oats

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375Â°F. Line 2
   rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk flour, salt, and
   baking soda together in medium bowl; set aside.
2. Melt butter in 8-inch skillet over medium-high heat, swirling pan
   occasionally, until foaming subsides. Continue to cook, stirring and
   scraping bottom of pan with heat-resistant spatula, until milk solids
   are dark golden brown and butter has nutty aroma, 1 to 2 minutes.
   Immediately transfer browned butter to large heatproof bowl, scraping
   skillet with spatula. Stir in cinnamon.
3. Add brown sugar, granulated sugar, and oil to bowl with butter and
   whisk until combined. Add egg and yolk and vanilla and whisk until
   mixture is smooth. Using wooden spoon or spatula, stir in flour
   mixture until fully combined, about 1 minute. Add oats and raisins,
   if using, and stir until evenly distributed (mixture will be stiff).
4. Divide dough into 20 portions, each about 3 tablespoons (or use #24
   cookie scoop). Arrange dough balls 2 inches apart on prepared sheets,
   10 dough balls per sheet. Using your damp hand, press each ball into
   2 1/2-inch disk.
5. Bake, 1 sheet at a time, until cookie edges are set and lightly
   browned and centers are still soft but not wet, 8 to 10 minutes,
   rotating sheet halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on sheet on
   wire rack for 5 minutes; using wide metal spatula, transfer cookies
   to wire rack and let cool completely.
