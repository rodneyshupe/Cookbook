Ingredients
-----------

- 3 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped
- 8 tablespoons unsalted butter(1 stick) , cut into chunks
- 1 cup sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon table salt
- 2 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2/3 cup all-purpose flour

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line
   8-inch baking dish with foil and coat foil with cooking spray.
2. Melt chocolate and butter in small bowl in microwave or in heatproof
   bowl set over pan of simmering water, stirring occasionally to combine.
   Cool mixture for several minutes.
3. Whisk sugar, baking powder, salt, eggs, and vanilla together in medium
   bowl until combined, about 15 seconds. Whisk in chocolate mixture until
   smooth. Stir in flour until no streaks of flour remain. Scrape batter
   evenly into prepared pan.
4. Bake until toothpick inserted halfway between edge and center of pan
   comes out clean, 22 to 27 minutes. Cool brownies on wire rack to room
   temperature, about 2 hours. Using foil, lift brownies from pan to
   cutting board. Slide foil out from under brownies and cut brownies into
   2-inch squares. (Brownies can be stored in airtight container for
   several days.)
