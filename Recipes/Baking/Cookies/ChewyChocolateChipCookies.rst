Makes 24 cookies

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons (10 2/3 ounces) all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 12 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- 1 cup packed (7 ounces) light brown sugar
- 1/2 cup (3 1/2 ounces) granulated sugar
- 1 large egg plus 1 large yolk
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 cups (9 ounces) semisweet chocolate chips

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees.
   Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine flour, baking soda, and
   salt in bowl.
2. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat melted butter, brown sugar, and
   granulated sugar on medium speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add egg
   and yolk and vanilla and beat until combined. Reduce speed to low and add
   flour mixture in 3 additions until just combined, scraping down bowl as
   needed. Stir in chocolate chips by hand.
3. Working with 2 tablespoons dough at a time, roll into balls and space them
   2 inches apart on prepared sheets. Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until
   edges are set and beginning to brown but centers are still soft and puffy,
   15 to 20 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Let cookies cool
   on sheets for 10 minutes before serving.

Note
----
To keep the cookies chewy longer, store them in an airtight container with a
slice of sandwich bread.
