These brownies are best served warm!

Ingredients
-----------

-  2/3 cup of melted butter
-  1/3 cup of cocoa
-  2 eggs
-  3/4 cup of sugar
-  1/2 cup of flour
-  1 teaspoon of baking powder

Directions
----------

1. Combine the cocoa, sugar, flour and baking powder in to one of the
   mixing bowls.
2. In the other mixing bowl, add the 2 eggs and beat them. Then add the
   melted butter and whisk until light and foamy. Once the butter and
   eggs are mixed well together add in the vanilla.
3. Add the wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients. Then mix
   ingredients together until they make the consistency of a batter.
   Once your bowl is rid of dry ingredients add in the chocolate chips
   and chopped nuts (optional). Mix again until chocolate chips are
   spread throughout the brownie batter.
4. Spray the 9x9 glass pan with the cooking spray and add the brownie
   batter into the pan and smooth out with the spatula.
5. You are now ready to cook the brownies in the microwave for 6 minutes
   on high.
6. Remove brownies from microwave. Cut into the desired amount of pieces
   and serve with a generous amount of vanilla ice cream.
