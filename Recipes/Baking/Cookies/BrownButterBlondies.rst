Ingredients
-----------

- 1 cup (226g) unsalted butter
- 2 1/4 cups (320g) flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons (8g) baking powder
- 1 1/2 teaspoons (8g) kosher salt
- 1/2 cup (125g) milk chocolate chunks
- 1/2 cup (118g) chopped walnuts
- 1/2 cup (30g) mini marshmallows
- 1 1/2 cups (300g) packed brown sugar
- 1/2 cup (120g) granulated sugar
- 2 eggs, room temperature
- 2 teaspoons (10ml) vanilla

Directions
----------

1. Preheat oven to 350F (176C). Spray a 9x13-inch (23x33cm) baking pan with
   cooking spray.
2. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, swirling pan
   occasionally. Once the butter foams, stir occasionally. Continue to cook
   until bubbles appear on the surface and the butter appears golden brown
   when stirred.
3. Immediately transfer to a large, heat-proof bowl and set aside to cool
   for 10 minutes.
4. Whisk together flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Stir in
   chocolate, walnuts and marshmallows.
5. Beat sugars into the cooled butter with a hand mixer until well combined
   in a large bowl.
6. Add eggs, one at a time along with vanilla into sugar mixture.
7. Stir in the flour mixture until combined.
8. Spoon the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread evenly into
   pan.
9. Bake until the edges are golden and the middle is set, about 30 to 35
   minutes. Cool and cut to serve.
