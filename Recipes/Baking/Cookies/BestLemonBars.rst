Ingredients
-----------

Crust
^^^^^
- 1 cup (5 ounces) all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

Filling
^^^^^^^
- 1 cup (7 ounces) granulated sugar
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons cream of tartar
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 3 large eggs plus 3 large yolks
- 2 teaspoons grated lemon zest plus 2/3 cup juice (4 lemons)
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces
- Confectioners' sugar (optional)

Directions
----------
1. FOR THE CRUST: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to
   350 degrees. Make foil sling for 8-inch square baking pan by folding
   2 long sheets of aluminum foil so each is 8 inches wide. Lay sheets of
   foil in pan perpendicular to each other, with extra foil hanging over
   edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing
   foil flush to pan.
2. Whisk flour, sugar, and salt together in bowl. Add melted butter and
   stir until combined. Transfer mixture to prepared pan and press into
   even layer over entire bottom of pan (do not wash bowl). Bake crust
   until dark golden brown, 19 to 24 minutes, rotating pan halfway
   through baking.
3. FOR THE FILLING: While crust bakes, whisk sugar, flour, cream of tartar,
   and salt together in now-empty bowl. Whisk in eggs and yolks until no
   streaks of egg remain. Whisk in lemon zest and juice. Transfer mixture
   to saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until
   mixture thickens and registers 160 degrees, 5 to 8 minutes. Off heat,
   stir in butter. Strain filling through fine-mesh strainer set over bowl.
4. Pour filling over hot crust and tilt pan to spread evenly. Bake until
   filling is set and barely jiggles when pan is shaken, 8 to 12 minutes.
   (Filling around perimeter of pan may be slightly raised.) Let bars cool
   completely, at least 1Â½ hours. Using foil overhang, lift bars out of pan
   and transfer to cutting board. Cut into bars, wiping knife clean between
   cuts as necessary. Before serving, dust bars with confectioners' sugar,
   if using.
