Ingredients
-----------

Crust
^^^^^

-  1 3/4 cups (8 3/4 ounces) all-purpose flour
-  6 tablespoons (2 2/3 ounces) sugar
-  1/2 teaspoon salt
-  8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

Topping
^^^^^^^

-  3/4 cup packed (5 1/4 ounces) light brown sugar
-  1/2 cup light corn syrup
-  7 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and hot
-  1 teaspoon vanilla extract
-  1/2 teaspoon salt
-  4 cups (1 pound) pecan halves, toasted
-  1/2 teaspoon flake sea salt (optional)

Directions
----------

1. FOR THe CRUST: Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to
   350°F. Make foil sling for 13 by 9-inch baking pan by folding 2 long
   sheets of aluminum foil; first sheet should be 13 inches wide and
   second sheet should be 9 inches wide. Lay sheets of foil in pan
   perpendicular to each other, with extra foil hanging over edges of
   pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush
   to pan. Lightly spray foil with vegetable oil spray.
2. Whisk flour, sugar, and salt together in medium bowl. Add melted
   butter and stir with wooden spoon until dough begins to form. Using
   your hands, continue to combine until no dry flour remains and small
   portion of dough holds together when squeezed in palm of your hand.
   evenly scatter tablespoon-size pieces of dough over surface of pan.
   Using your fingertips and palm of your hand, press and smooth dough
   into even thickness in bottom of pan.
3. FOR THe TOPPING: Whisk sugar, corn syrup, melted butter, vanilla, and
   salt together in medium bowl until smooth (mixture will look
   separated at first but will become homogeneous), about 20 seconds.
   Fold pecans into sugar mixture until nuts are evenly coated.
4. Pour topping over crust. Using spatula, spread topping over crust,
   pushing to edges and into corners (there will be bare patches). Bake
   until topping is evenly distributed and rapidly bubbling across
   entire surface, 23 to 25 minutes.
5. Transfer pan to wire rack and lightly sprinkle with flake sea salt,
   if using. Let bars cool completely in pan on rack, about 1 1/2 hours.
   Using foil overhang, lift bars out of pan and transfer to cutting
   board. Cut into 24 bars. (Bars can be stored at room temperature for
   up to 5 days.)

Notes
-----

*It is important to use pecan halves, not pieces. The edges of the bars
will be slightly firmer than the center. If desired, trim 1/4 inch from
the edges before cutting into bars. Toast the pecans on a rimmed baking
sheet in a 350°F oven until fragrant, 8 to 12 minutes, shaking the sheet
halfway through.*
