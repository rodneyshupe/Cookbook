Mary's Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies
=====================================

Ingredients
-----------
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 2 cups brown sugar
- 1 cup margarine
- 2 eggs
- 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 cups rolled oats
- 1 cup chocolate chips

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375Â°F. Line 2
   rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk flour, salt, baking
   soda and backing powder together in medium bowl; set aside.
2. In a large bowl mix together sugar and margarine until combined. Add
   in eggs and vanilla and combine until mixture is smooth.
3. Using wooden spoon or spatula, stir in flour mixture until fully
   combined, about 1 minute. Add oats and chocolate chips and stir until
   evenly distributed (mixture will be stiff).
4. Divide dough into 20 portions, each about 3 tablespoons (or use #24
   cookie scoop). Arrange dough balls 2 inches apart on prepared sheets,
   10 dough balls per sheet. Using your damp hand, press each ball into
   2 1/2-inch disk.
5. Bake, 1 sheet at a time, until cookie edges are set and lightly
   browned and centers are still soft but not wet, 10 to 12 minutes,
   rotating sheet halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on sheet on
   wire rack for 5 minutes; using wide metal spatula, transfer cookies
   to wire rack and let cool completely.
