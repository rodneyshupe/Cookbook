===============================

+------------------+----------------------------------+------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Prep: 15 minutes | Resting Time: 2 hours - 12 hours | Baking: 2 hours proofing + 1 hour baking | Yield: 1 round loaf or 2 8-inch loaves or 3 baguettes |
+------------------+----------------------------------+------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

Ingredients
-----------
- 400 grams (2 1/2 cups + 3 tablespoons) bread flour (can sub all purpose)
- 1 gram (1/4 teaspoon) instant yeast
- 10 grams salt
- 300 grams/ml water (room temperature) (for more flavour use 205g water + 85g beer + 10g vinegar)

Directions
----------
1. In a large bowl whisk together flour, yeast and salt. Add liquids, and
   stir until blended; dough will be shaggy and sticky. Cover bowl with
   plastic wrap. Let dough rest at least 10 - 12 hours, at warm room
   temperature, about 70 degrees.
2. You can continue with step 3 immediately, but for a better flavour
   and texture, I strongly recommend letting this risen dough rest in the
   refrigerator for at least 12 hours and up to 3 days. Then getting ready
   to back take out of the refrigerator and let warm at room temperature
   for 1 1/2 - 2 hours.
3. Dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles. Lightly flour a
   work surface and place dough on it; sprinkle it with a little more flour
   and fold it over on itself once or twice. Cover loosely with plastic
   wrap and let rest about 15 minutes. Using just enough flour to keep dough
   from sticking to work surface or to your fingers, gently and quickly
   shape dough into a ball. Generously coat a square of parchment paper with
   flour, wheat bran or cornmeal; transfer dough to parchment and dust with
   more flour, bran or cornmeal. Cover with cotton towel and let rise for
   about 2 hours. When it is ready, dough will be more than double in size
   and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.
4. At least a half-hour before dough is ready, heat oven to 450 degrees. Put
   a 6 to 8 quart dutch oven (or heavy covered pot, enamel, Pyrex or ceramic)
   in oven as it heats. When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven.
   Pick up parchment and dough and lower into the pot.  Using a sharp knife
   or razor, create a slit across the top.  Cover with lid and bake
   30 minutes, then remove lid and bake another 15 to 30 minutes, until loaf
   is beautifully browned. Cool on a rack.

Variations
----------

Whole Wheat
^^^^^^^^^^^
Change Flour to 250 grams all purpose and 150 grams whole wheat.
Add 1 tablespoon honey to wet ingredients)

Quick loaf
^^^^^^^^^^
Use 8 grams yeast and 1 teaspoons honey and shorten the first rise to 1-2 hours.

Longer loaves or baguettes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Adjust ingredients as follows: 425g flour + 315ml water (or 210g water + 90g beer + 15g vinegar)
In step 3, turn the cold dough out onto a floured work surface. Using a
sharp knife or bench scraper, cut dough in half or into thirds. Using
floured hands, shape into 2 or 3 long loaves about 9×3 (or 9 x 2) inches each.
Prepare a baking sheet by lining with parchment and sprinkled with cornmeal.
Place loafs on prepared sheet spaced about 3 inches apart. Loosely cover and
allow to rest for 2 hours. You can bake the dough on this prepared baking
sheet or see note if you want to use a pizza stone.

Additional Flavours
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Before pouring in the water in step 1, add any of the following
ingredients/combination of ingredients to the dry ingredients in the bowl:
- 4 cloves minced garlic + 3 Tablespoons chopped rosemary
- 3 Tablespoons your favourite fresh herb (chopped)
- 1 cup your favourite shredded cheese
- a diced jalapeño
- 3/4 – 1 cup dried cranberries and/or chopped nuts
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder, etc.

Notes
-----
* Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: The dough can sit in the refrigerator
  for up to 3 days, so this is a wonderful recipe to begin ahead of time. You
  can also bake the bread, allow it to cool, and freeze for up to 3 months.
  Thaw in the refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature before
  serving. You can also freeze the dough. Complete the recipe through step 2.
  Wrap in plastic wrap and place in a freezer-friendly container. To bake,
  allow dough to thaw overnight in the refrigerator, or for 2-3 hours at room
  temperature. Continue with step 3 and the rest of the recipe instructions.
* Using a pizza stone: If you want to bake your bread loaves on a pizza stone,
  place pizza stone in the preheating oven. Transfer shaped and scored loaf
  to hot pizza stone and bake as directed.
* If not using a dutch oven with a lid you can use a sheet pan or pizza stone.
  If you still want a crispy crust, after the oven is preheated and bread is
  scored, place a shallow metal or cast iron baking pan or skillet (I usually
  use a metal 9×13 baking pan) on the bottom oven rack. Carefully and quickly
  pour 3-4 cups of boiling water into it. Place the scored dough/baking pan on
  a higher rack and quickly shut the oven, trapping the steam inside. The
  team helps create a crispier crust.
