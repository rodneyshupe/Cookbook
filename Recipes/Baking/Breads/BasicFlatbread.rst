Basic Flatbread
===============

Ingredients
-----------

- 300 grams flour, any wheat sort (white, wholemeal even SR or plain/all-purpose)
- 3/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 180 grams cold water.

Directions
----------

1. Add flour, baking powder, and salt to food processor and lock lid into
   place. Turn on processor and process until combined, about 5 seconds. Stop
   processor and remove lid. Add oil and lock lid back into place. Process
   until no visible streaks of oil remain, about 10 seconds.
2. With processor running, slowly pour water through feed tube and process
   until dough forms soft ball that clears sides of processor bowl, 30 to 60
   seconds. Stop processor, remove lid, and carefully remove processor blade.
3. Sprinkle clean counter with extra flour and coat your hands in flour.
   Transfer dough to counter, knead for 30 seconds, then form dough into
   smooth ball.
4. Use bench scraper to divide dough into 4 equal pieces. Working with
   1 piece of dough at a time, shape dough into ball (click here to learn
   how to shape dough into balls). Repeat with remaining pieces of dough.
   Cover dough balls loosely with plastic wrap. Let sit for 30 minutes.
5. When dough is ready, sprinkle extra flour on clean counter. Use your
   fingertips to gently pat 1 dough ball into 5-inch circle (keep remaining
   dough balls covered). Use rolling pin to roll dough into 9-inch circle,
   flouring counter as needed to prevent sticking. Repeat rolling with
   remaining dough balls.
6. Heat 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat for 3 minutes (skillet
   should be hot but not smoking).
7. Gently prick 1 dough round all over with fork, then carefully place in
   skillet (ask an adult for help). Cook until underside is spotty brown,
   1 to 2 minutes. Use spatula to carefully flip dough round and cook until
   second side is spotty brown, 1 to 2 minutes.
8. Use spatula to carefully transfer flatbread to plate and cover with clean
   dish towel to keep warm. Repeat with remaining dough rounds, stacking
   flatbreads and re-covering with towel as they finish. Serve warm.

Variations
----------
* Naan: substitute 340 grams greek yogurt for the oil and water.
* Garlic Naan: Substitute yogurt as above. Then when cooking, once the first
  side of the naan is cooked, flip the naan over and brush the cooked side
  with olive oil, sprinkle with about 1/4 teaspoon of cilantro and
  1/4 teaspoon of garlic. When the second side is cooked, flip the garlic
  side onto the griddle surface for just a few seconds. The hot surface will
  help seal the garlic to the naan.
* Sesame Naan: Substitute yogurt as above. Then when cooking, brush with a
  little olive oil when the naan is done cooking and sprinkle 1 side with
  sesame seeds. Place the sesame seed side of the naan onto the cooking
  surface for just a few seconds to seal the sesame seeds into the surface
  of the naan.
