Ingredients
-----------

- 3 cups (16 1/2 ounces) bread flour (468g)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons instant or rapid-rise yeast
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup mild lager, room temperature (236g)
- 6 tablespoons water, room temperature (89g)
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 5 ounces (1/4-inch-thick) provolone cheese, cut into 1/2-inch pieces (optional)
- 3 ounces (1/4-inch-thick) sliced prosciutto, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 3 ounces (1/4-inch-thick) sliced pepperoni, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 3 ounces (1/4-inch-thick) sliced capicola, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1 1/2 teaspoons coarsely ground pepper
- Cornmeal

Directions
----------

1. Whisk flour, yeast, and salt together in bowl of stand mixer. Whisk
   beer, room-temperature water, and oil together in 2-cup liquid measuring
   cup.
2. Fit mixer with dough hook. Mix flour mixture on low speed while slowly
   adding beer mixture until cohesive dough starts to form and no dry flour
   remains, about 2 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed. Increase speed
   to medium and knead until dough is smooth and elastic and clears sides
   of bowl, about 8 minutes.
3. Reduce speed to low and add provolone (if using), prosciutto, pepperoni,
   capicola, and pepper. Continue to knead until combined, about 2 minutes
   longer (some meats and cheese may not be fully incorporated into dough at
   this point; this is OK). Transfer dough and any errant pieces of meats and
   cheese to lightly floured counter and knead by hand to evenly incorporate
   meats and cheese into dough, about 1 minute.
4. Form dough into smooth, round ball and place seam side down in lightly
   greased large bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let dough rise
   at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.
5. Line baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly dust with cornmeal.
   Turn out dough onto counter and gently press down to deflate any large
   air pockets. Cut dough into 2 even pieces. Press each piece of dough
   into 8 by 5-inch rectangle with long side parallel to counter's edge.
6. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, fold top edge of rectangle down
   to midline, pressing to seal. Fold bottom edge of rectangle up to
   midline and pinch to seal. Flip dough seam side down and gently roll
   into 12-inch loaf with tapered ends. Transfer loaf to 1 side of prepared
   sheet. Repeat shaping with second piece of dough and place loaf about 3
   inches from first loaf on sheet. Cover with greased plastic and let rise
   at room temperature until puffy and dough springs back slowly when
   pressed lightly with your finger, about 45 minutes.
7. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Using
   sharp paring knife in swift, fluid motion, make 1/2-inch-deep lengthwise
   slash along top of each loaf, starting and stopping about 1 1/2 inches
   from ends. Bake until loaves register 205 to 210 degrees, 22 to 25
   minutes. Transfer loaves to wire rack and let cool completely, about 3
   hours. Serve.
8. TO MAKE AHEAD: Make dough through step 3, form into ball, and place seam
   side down in lightly greased large bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap
   and refrigerate for at least 16 hours or up to 24 hours. Let dough come
   to room temperature, about 3 hours, before proceeding with step five.

Notes
-----

We love the combination of prosciutto, pepperoni, and capicola in this
bread, but you can use 9 ounces of any combination of your favourite cured
meats; just be sure to have each sliced 1/4 inch thick at the deli counter.
Do not use thinly sliced deli meats and cheese, as they will adversely
affect the bread's texture. Use a mild lager, such as Budweiser; strongly
flavoured beers will make this bread taste bitter.
