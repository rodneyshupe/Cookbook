Ingredients
-----------

- 1 cup (120g) cornmeal
- 1 cup (125g) all-purpose flour (spoon &amp; leveled)
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled
- 1/3 cup (67g) packed light or dark brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) honey
- 1 large egg, at room temperature
- 1 cup (240ml) buttermilk, at room temperature*

Directions
----------

1. Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). Grease and lightly flour an 8 or 9-inch
   square baking pan. Set aside.
2. Whisk the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together
   in a large bowl. Set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk the melted butter,
   brown sugar, and honey together until completely smooth and thick. Then,
   whisk in the egg until combined. Finally, whisk in the buttermilk. Pour
   the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until combined.
   Avoid over-mixing.
3. Pour batter into prepared baking pan. Bake for 20 minutes or until
   golden brown on top and the center is cooked through. Use a toothpick to
   test. Edges should be crispy at this point. Allow to slightly cool
   before slicing and serving. Serve cornbread with butter, honey, jam, or
   whatever you like.
4. Wrap leftovers up tightly and store at room temperature for up to 1 week.

Notes
-----

- Freezing Instructions: For longer storage, freeze baked cornbread for up to
  3 months. Allow to thaw overnight in the refrigerator and heat up in the
  microwave or bake in a 300°F (149°C) oven for 10 minutes.
- Optional add-ins: 1-2 chopped jalapeño peppers, 1 cup blueberries,
  1 cup total dried cranberries and walnuts, 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese,
  or 1/2 cup bacon crumbles. Fold into batter after all other ingredients are
  combined.
- Skillet Cornbread: Baking cornbread in a skillet gives it an even heartier,
  crunchy crust. Bake this cornbread in a 9-inch or 10-inch oven safe greased
  skillet at the same temperature for the same amount of time.
- Cornbread Muffins:

  * Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C). Line a 12-count muffin pan with liners or
    spray with nonstick spray. This recipe makes about 14 muffins, so there
    will be a 2nd batch. Set pan aside.
  * Make batter same as above.
  * Spoon batter into muffin liners, filling all the way to the top. Bake for
    5 minutes 425°F (218°C) then, keeping the muffins in the oven, reduce heat
    to 350°F (177°C) and continue baking for another 16-17 minutes. The total
    time these muffins should be in the oven is around 21-23 minutes. Use a
    toothpick to test. If it comes out clean, the muffins are done.
