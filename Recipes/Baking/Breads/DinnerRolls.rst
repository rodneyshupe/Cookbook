Dinner Rolls
============

Ingredients
-----------

Flour Paste
^^^^^^^^^^^
- 1/2 cup water
- 3 tablespoons bread flour

Dough
^^^^^
- 1/2 cup cold milk
- 1 large egg
- 2 cups (11 ounces) bread flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons instant or rapid-rise yeast
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, plus 1/2 tablespoon, melted

Directions
----------

1. FOR THE FLOUR PASTE: Whisk water and flour together in small bowl until
   no lumps remain. Microwave, whisking every 20 seconds, until mixture
   thickens to stiff, smooth, pudding-like consistency that forms mound when
   dropped from end of whisk into bowl, 40 to 80 seconds.
2. FOR THE DOUGH: In bowl of stand mixer, whisk flour paste and milk
   together until smooth. Add egg and whisk until incorporated. Add flour
   and yeast. Fit stand mixer with dough hook and mix on low speed until all
   flour is moistened, 1 to 2 minutes. Let stand for 15 minutes.
3. Add sugar and salt and mix on medium-low speed for 5 minutes. With mixer
   running, add softened butter, 1 tablespoon at a time. Continue to mix on
   medium-low speed 5 minutes longer, scraping down dough hook and sides of
   bowl occasionally (dough will stick to bottom of bowl).
4. Transfer dough to very lightly floured counter. Knead briefly to form
   ball and transfer, seam side down, to lightly greased bowl; lightly coat
   surface of dough with vegetable oil spray and cover with plastic wrap.
   Let rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
5. Grease 9-inch round cake pan and set aside. Transfer dough to counter.
   Press dough gently but firmly to expel all air. Pat and stretch dough to
   form 8 by 9-inch rectangle with short side facing you. Cut dough
   lengthwise into 4 equal strips and cut each strip crosswise into 3 equal
   pieces. Working with 1 piece at a time, stretch and press dough gently to
   form 8 by 2-inch strip. Starting on short side, roll dough to form snug
   cylinder and arrange shaped rolls seam side down in prepared pan, placing
   10 rolls around edge of pan, pointing inward, and remaining 2 rolls in
   center. Cover with plastic and let rise until doubled, 45 minutes to
   1 hour.
6. When rolls are nearly doubled, adjust oven rack to lowest position and
   heat oven to 375 degrees. Bake rolls until deep golden brown,
   25 to 30 minutes. Let rolls cool in pan on wire rack for 3 minutes;
   invert rolls onto rack, then reinvert. Brush tops and sides of rolls with
   melted butter. Let rolls cool for at least 20 minutes before serving.
