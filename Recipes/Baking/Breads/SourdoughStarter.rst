Ingredients
-----------
- 4 1/2 cups (24 3/4 ounces) whole-wheat flour
- 5 cups (25 ounces) all-purpose flour, plus extra for maintaining starter
- Water, room temperature

Directions
----------
1. Combine whole-wheat flour and all-purpose flour in large container. Using
   wooden spoon, mix 1 cup (5 ounces) flour mixture and 2/3 cup (5 1/3 ounces)
   room-temperature water in glass bowl until no dry flour remains (reserve
   remaining flour mixture). Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room
   temperature until bubbly and fragrant, 48 to 72 hours.
2. FEED STARTER: Measure out 1/4 cup (2 ounces) starter and transfer to clean
   bowl or jar; discard remaining starter. Stir 1/2 cup (2 1/2 ounces) flour
   mixture and 1/4 cup (2 ounces) room-temperature water into starter until
   no dry flour remains. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room
   temperature for 24 hours.
3. Repeat step 2 every 24 hours until starter is pleasantly aromatic and
   doubles in size 8 to 12 hours after being fed, 10 to 14 days. At this point
   starter is mature and ready to be baked with, or it can be moved to storage.
   (If baking, use starter once it has doubled in size during 8-to-12-hour
   window. Use starter within 1 hour after it starts to deflate once reaching
   its peak.)
4. TO STORE AND MAINTAIN MATURE STARTER: Measure out 1/4 cup (2 ounces)
   starter and transfer to clean bowl; discard remaining starter. Stir
   1/2 cup (2 1/2 ounces) all-purpose flour and 1/4 cup (2 ounces)
   room-temperature water into starter until no dry flour remains. Transfer
   to clean container that can be loosely covered (plastic container or mason
   jar with its lid inverted) and let sit at room temperature for 5 hours.
   Cover and transfer to refrigerator. If not baking regularly, repeat
   process weekly.
5. TO PREPARE FOR BAKING: Eighteen to 24 hours before baking, measure out
   1/2 cup (4 ounces) starter and transfer to clean bowl; discard remaining
   starter. Stir 1 cup (5 ounces) all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup (4 ounces)
   room-temperature water into starter until no dry flour remains. Cover and
   let sit at room temperature for 5 hours. Measure out amount of starter
   called for in bread recipe and transfer to second bowl. Cover and
   refrigerate for at least 12 hours or up to 18 hours. Remaining starter
   should be refrigerated and maintained as directed.
