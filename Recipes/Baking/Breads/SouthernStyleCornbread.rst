========================

Ingredients
-----------
-  1 1/2 cups stone-ground cornmeal
-  1 cup all-purpose flour
-  2 tablespoons sugar
-  1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
-  1/4 teaspoon baking soda
-  1 1/4 teaspoons salt
-  3 ears corn, kernels cut from cobs (2 1/4 cups) (can substitute 14oz can of corn niblets)
-  6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 6 pieces
-  1 cup buttermilk (substitute 1 1/2 teaspoons of cream of tartar and 1 cup regular milk)
-  2 large eggs plus 1 large yolk


Directions
----------
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400Â°F. Whisk
   cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together
   in large bowl.
2. Process corn kernels in blender until very smooth, about 2 minutes.
   Transfer puree to medium saucepan (you should have about 1 1/2 cups).
   Cook puree over medium heat, stirring constantly, until very thick
   and deep yellow and it measures 3/4 cup, 5 to 8 minutes.
3. Remove pan from heat. Add 5 tablespoons butter and whisk until melted
   and incorporated. Add buttermilk and whisk until incorporated. Add
   eggs and yolk and whisk until incorporated. Transfer corn mixture to
   bowl with cornmeal mixture and, using rubber spatula, fold together
   until just combined.
4. Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in 10-inch cast-iron skillet over
   medium heat. Scrape batter into skillet and spread into even layer.
   Bake until top is golden brown and toothpick inserted in center comes
   out clean, 23 to 28 minutes. Let cool on wire rack for 5 minutes.
   Remove cornbread from skillet and let cool for 20 minutes before
   cutting into wedges and serving.
