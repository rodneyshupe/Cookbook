Brioche Bread
=============

Yield: Yields 2 medium loaves or 1 large loaf.

Ingredients
-----------

The sponge
^^^^^^^^^^

- 1/3 cup whole milk, warm (100°F)
- 1 1/8 teaspoon active dry yeast
- 1 pinch sugar
- 1 1/4 cup bread flour, (unsifted)


The dough
^^^^^^^^^

- 6 oz butter, (unsalted) cold
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 1/4 teaspoon Salt
- 4 large egg
- 1 large egg, for egg wash

Directions
----------

#. For the sponge; pour the milk into a small bowl and sprinkle the yeast over it. Add the sugar and stir. Mix in 1/2 cup of flour until well blended. Scatter the remaining 3/4 cup flour over the top to cover the sponge. Let stand at room temp. until the mixture is spongy and doubles in volume, about 30- 35 minutes (the flour on top of the sponge will crack).
#. For the dough; remove the cold butter from the fridge. Place a strip of plastic wrap on a work surface, unwrap the butter and place on the plastic strip. Set the butter wrappings on top of the butter, and hit with a rolling pin to flatten and soften. Set nearby at room temp.
#. Pour the flour, sugar and salt into a 14 cup capacity food processor bowl, fitted with the steel blade. Pulse briefly to blend ingredients. Pour sponge over dry ingredients and pulse 3-5 times to incorporate yeast mixture. Put the eggs on top of dry ingredients and process for 15-20 seconds. Continue to process until most of the dough wraps around the blade. Remove the dough. Turn out the two onto a lightly floured work surface and gently knead until a smooth, cohesive dough forms, about 1 minute.
#. Put the dough into a large bowl, cover with plastic wrap. Cover bowl securely with another piece of plastic wrap. Let rise in a cool place until doubled in volume, about 2- 2 1/2 hours. Gently punch down and place in a clean bowl, place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the dough, cover bowl securely with plastic wrap, and refrigerate over night.
#. To form brioche loaves; lightly grease two pans and form into loaves.
#. Cover the pan with plastic wrap, and leave it at room temp. for 3 hours. Preheat the oven to 37°F. Beat the egg with a tsp. of water. Brush the top of the loaves. Bake for 35 minutes or until golden. Remove and cool on a wire rack.
