Ingredients
-----------

- 463g All Pupose Flour
- 14g Yeast
- 31g Sugar
- 30g Nido (Milk Powder)
- 9g Salt
- 41g Melted Butter
- 220g Lukewarm Water
- 2 Large Eggs, one beaten
- Sesame Seeds

Directions
----------
1. Whisk flour and yeast together in bowl of stand mixer, then add
   room-temperature water and 2 eggs. Fit mixer with dough hook and mix on
   low speed until dough comes together and no dry flour remains, about
   2 minutes, scraping down bowl and dough hook frequently. Turn off mixer,
   cover bowl with dish towel or plastic wrap, and let dough stand for
   15 minutes.
2. Add sugar and salt to dough and knead on medium-low speed until
   incorporated, about 30 seconds. Increase speed to medium and, with mixer
   running, add butter 1 piece at a time, allowing each piece to
   incorporate before adding next, about 3 minutes total, scraping down
   bowl and dough hook as needed. Continue to knead on medium speed until
   dough is elastic and pulls away cleanly from sides of bowl, about
   10 minutes longer. Transfer dough to greased large bowl. Cover tightly
   with plastic and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size,
   about 1 hour.
3. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Turn out dough onto
   counter and divide dough into twelve 3-ounce portions; divide any
   remaining dough evenly among portions. Working with 1 dough portion at
   a time, cup dough with your palm and roll against counter into smooth,
   tight ball. Evenly space 6 dough balls on each prepared sheet. Using
   greased bottom of dry measuring cup, press dough balls to 3-inch
   diameter, about 3/4 inch thick. Poke any air bubbles in dough balls
   with tip of paring knife.
4. Cover loosely with plastic and let rise at room temperature until
   doubled in size, about 1 hour. Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and
   lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees.
5. Discard plastic and brush tops and sides of dough balls with beaten egg
   (you do not need to use all of it). Sprinkle tops of dough balls with
   sesame seeds, if using.
6. Bake until buns are deep golden brown and register 205 to 210 degrees
   in center, 18 to 20 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway
   through baking. Transfer sheets to wire racks and let cool completely,
   about 30 minutes. Serve. (Buns can be stored in zipper-lock bags at
   room temperature for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 1 month.)

TO MAKE AHEAD: Before second rise, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate
for up to 24 hours. Let dough sit at room temperature for 2 hours before
baking. Increasing baking time by 5 minutes.
