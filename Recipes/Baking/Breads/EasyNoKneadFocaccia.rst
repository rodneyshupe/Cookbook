Easy No-Knead Focaccia
======================

Ingredients
-----------
- 1 1/4-oz. (8g) envelope active dry yeast (about 2 1/4 tsp.)
- 2 tsp. honey
- 5 cups (625 g) all-purpose flour
- 5 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 Tbsp. Morton kosher salt
- 6 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more for hands
- 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, plus more for pan
- Flaky sea salt
- 2 garlic cloves

Directions
----------
1. Whisk one envelope active dry yeast, honey, and 2 1/2 cups lukewarm water
   in a medium bowl and let sit 5 minutes (it should foam or at least get
   creamy; if it doesn’t your yeast is dead and you should start again—check
   the expiration date!).
2. Add flour and salt and mix with a rubber spatula until a shaggy dough
   forms and no dry streaks remain.
3. Pour 4 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil into a large bowl. Transfer dough to
   bowl and turn to coat in oil. Cover with lid or plastic wrap and chill in
   refrigerator until dough is doubled in size (it should look very bubbly
   and alive), at least 8 hours and up to 1 day. If you're in a rush, you
   can also let it rise at room temperature until doubled in size, 3–4 hours.
4. Spray a 13x9" baking pan then pour 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil into
   center of pan. Keeping the dough in the bowl and using a fork in each
   hand, gather up edges of dough farthest from you and lift up and over
   into center of bowl. Give the bowl a quarter turn and repeat process. Do
   this 2 more times; you want to deflate dough while you form it into a
   rough ball. Transfer dough to prepared pan. Pour any oil left in bowl
   over and turn dough to coat it in oil. Let rise, uncovered, in a dry,
   warm spot until doubled in size, at least 1 1/2 hours and up to 4 hours.
5. Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 450°. To see if the dough is
   ready, poke it with your finger. It should spring back slowly, leaving a
   small visible indentation. If it springs back quickly, the dough isn’t
   ready. (If at this point the dough is ready to bake but you aren’t, you
   can chill it up to 1 hour.) Lightly oil your hands. Gently stretch out
   dough to fill baking pan, if needed. Dimple focaccia all over with your
   fingers, like you’re aggressively playing the piano, creating very deep
   depressions in the dough (reach your fingers all the way to the bottom
   of the pan). Drizzle with remaining 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil and
   sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Bake focaccia until puffed and golden
   brown all over, 20–30 minutes.
6. Hold off on this last step until you're ready to serve the focaccia:
   Melt 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.
   Remove from heat. Peel and grate in garlic cloves with a Microplane.
   Return to medium heat and cook, stirring often, until garlic is just
   lightly toasted, 30–45 seconds. (Or, if you prefer raw garlic to
   toasted garlic, you can grate the garlic into the hot butter, off
   heat, then brush right away.)
7. Brush garlic-butter all over focaccia and slice into squares or
   rectangles.

Note
----

Variation: The called for 13x9" baking pan creates a thicker focaccia
that’s perfect for sandwiches. Alternatively use a 18x13" rimmed baking
sheet, for focaccia that's thinner, crispier, and great for snacking.

Make Ahead: Focaccia is best eaten the day it's made, but keeps well in the
freezer. Slice it into pieces, store it in a freezer-safe container, then
reheat it on a baking sheet in a 300° F oven.
