===============================

Source: `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/9075-sourdough-starter>`__

Ingredients
-----------
- 3 2/3 cups (18 1/3 ounces) all-purpose flour or bread flour
- 1 3/4 teaspoons salt
- 1 1/2 cups plus 4 teaspoons (12 2/3 ounces) water, room temperature
- 1/3 cup (3 ounces) mature `Sourdough Starter <#sourdough-starter>`__

Directions
----------
1. Whisk flour and salt together in medium bowl. Whisk room-temperature water
   and starter in large bowl until smooth. Add flour mixture to water mixture
   and stir using wooden spoon, scraping up dry flour from bottom of bowl
   until dough comes together, then knead by hand in bowl until shaggy ball
   forms and no dry flour remains. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sit at
   room temperature for at least 12 hours or up to 18 hours.
2. Lay 12 by 12-inch sheet of parchment paper on counter and spray generously
   with vegetable oil spray. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter and
   knead 10 to 15 times. Shape dough into ball by pulling edges into middle.
   Transfer dough, seam side down, to center of parchment. Pick up dough by
   lifting parchment edges and lower into heavy-bottomed Dutch oven. Cover
   with plastic wrap.
3. Adjust oven rack to middle position and place loaf or cake pan in bottom of
   oven. Place pot on middle rack and pour 3 cups of boiling water into pan
   below. Close oven door and let dough rise until doubled in size and does
   not readily spring back when poked with your floured finger, 2 to 3 hours.
4. Remove pot and water pan from oven; discard plastic from pot. Lightly flour
   top of dough and, using razor blade or sharp knife, make one 7-inch-long,
   1/2-inch-deep slit along top of dough. Cover pot and place on middle rack
   in oven. Heat oven to 425 degrees. Bake bread for 30 minutes (starting
   timing as soon as you turn on oven).
5. Remove lid and continue to bake until loaf is deep brown and registers
   210 degrees, 20 to 30 minutes longer. Carefully remove bread from pot;
   transfer to wire rack and let cool completely before serving.
