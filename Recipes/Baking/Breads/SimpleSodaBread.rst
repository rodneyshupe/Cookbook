Ingredients
-----------

- 2 cups all-purpose flour ($0.27)
- 1/2 tsp baking soda ($0.01)
- 1/2 tsp salt ($0.06)
- 1 cup buttermilk* ($0.32)

Directions
----------

1. Set a rack in the middle of your oven and preheat it to 450°F. Mix the
   flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl until they are fully
   incorporated.
2. Form a well in the center of the flour mixture and fill the well with
   the buttermilk.
3. Use a fork to incorporate the flour into the buttermilk little by little
   until a thick batter forms. Use your hands to incorporate the final bits
   of flour and gently shape the batter into a dough. Do not overwork the
   dough.
4. Transfer the dough to a floured work surface and gently shape it into a
   round 6 inches in diameter and about 1 1/2 inches thick.
5. Place the dough in a Dutch oven or cast iron skillet. Use a sharp knife
   to cut a large x into the top of the dough.
6. Bake for 10 minutes at 450°F. Then lower the oven temperature to 400°F
   and continue baking until the bread is golden brown and crusty on the
   outside, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a rack and cool.
