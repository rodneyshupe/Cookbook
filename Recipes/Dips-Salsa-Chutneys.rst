Guacamole
=========

+----------------------+--------------------------+---------------+
| Prep Time: 5 minutes | Cooking Time: 10 minutes | Yield: 2 cups |
+----------------------+--------------------------+---------------+

I got this recipe from my friend Scott. According to him:
    This recipe is the best guacamole ever.

Ingredients
------------

-  3 medium avocados, ripe
-  2 tablespoons minced onion
-  1 medium clove garlic, minced
-  1 small jalapeno chili, minced (1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons)
-  1/4 cup minced fresh cilantro leaves
-  1/4 teaspoon table salt
-  1/2 - 3/4 teaspoon ground cumin
-  2 tablespoons lime juice

Directions
----------

1. Halve one avocado, remove pit, and scoop flesh into medium bowl. Mash
   flesh lightly with onion, garlic, jalapeno, cilantro, salt, and cumin
   (if using) with tines of a fork until just combined. *To minimize the
   risk of discoloration, prepare the minced ingredients first so they
   are ready to mix with the avocados as soon as they are cut.*
2. Halve and pit remaining two avocados, and prepare. Gently scoop out
   avocado into bowl with mashed avocado mixture.
3. Sprinkle lime juice over diced avocado and mix entire contents of
   bowl lightly with fork until combined but still chunky. Adjust
   seasoning with salt, if necessary, and serve. (Can be covered with
   plastic wrap, pressed directly onto surface of mixture, and
   refrigerated up to one day. Return guacamole to room temperature,
   removing plastic wrap at the last moment, before serving).

Sun-Dried Tomato and Basil Salsa
================================

+-----------------------+-------------------------+----------------+
| Prep Time: 10 minutes | Cooking Time: 5 minutes | Yield: 1/2 cup |
+-----------------------+-------------------------+----------------+

Source: `Cooks
Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/8060-sun-dried-tomato-and-basil-salsa-for-two>`__

For a twist on a traditional salsa made with fresh tomatoes, we use
jarred sun-dried tomatoes. (We find that the oil-packed type have the
best flavor.) Fresh basil and parsley add herbal depth, while balsamic
vinegar and extra-virgin olive oil turn it into a sauce.

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 tablespoons oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, rinsed and chopped fine
-  2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
-  2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat leaf parsley
-  2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
-  1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
-  1/2 small shallot, minced
-  Salt and pepper

Directions
----------

1. Combine all ingredients in bowl and season with salt and pepper to
   taste.

   the spoon.

   of salt. Then squeeze the juice of half a lemon on top.

   heat olive oil and sliced garlic in small skillet over medium-low
   heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 15
   minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer sliced garlic to paper
   towel-lined plate and set aside; reserve oil. Once roasted garlic is
   cool, squeeze cloves from their skins (you should have about 1/4
   cup).
