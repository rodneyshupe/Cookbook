Peri Peri Sauce
===============

This is a sauce with some history: Its primary ingredient, a particular
hot chili, comes from the New World via the Portuguese, who brought it
to their colonies of Mozambique and Angola. This fiery, fragrant sauce
is equally common in Portugal and Africa these days, and goes
wonderfully with grilled chicken, fish or shrimp.

This recipe makes about 1 cup.

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 tablespoons red hot chili paste or 10 red hot chiles, such as Thai
-  1/2 cup fresh lemon juice (4-5 lemons)
-  2 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro (optional)
-  1 tablespoon chopped flat leaf parsley (optional)
-  5 chopped garlic cloves
-  1/2 teaspoons salt
-  1/2 cup olive

Directions
----------

1. If you are using fresh red chiles – it is important that they be red,
   for the proper color of piri piri – chop them roughly. If you really
   want to make this authentic, find yourself the tiny “bird’s eye”
   chiles, which are appallingly hot. Any hot chile will do, though.
2. Throw everything into a food processor except the oil. Buzz on high
   until smooth.
3. Once the sauce begins to get smooth, drizzle in the oil slowly while
   the machine is running. Once it is all incorporated, put the sauce in
   a glass jar and let stand at room temperature for up to a day.
4. For longer storage, seal in a jar and keep in the fridge up to a
   month.
