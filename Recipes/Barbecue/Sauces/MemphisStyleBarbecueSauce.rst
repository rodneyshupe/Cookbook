Memphis Style Barbecue Sauce
============================

Whether there is a true style to a sauce in a city that prefers their
barbecue “dry” is a debate for the ages. Through the rumblings I’m sure
will follow, what is fairly solid is as we move east from Kansas City,
barbecue sauce starts to transform from thick and sweet, to the thinner
and tangier kind. This “Memphis-style” takes the aspects of sweet
tomato-based sauces, but by dialing back the sugar and amping up the
vinegar, creates a sauce where seasonings and spice are more defined and
achieves a pleasing balance between the main defining aspects of a
barbecue sauce.

This thinner sauce bakes into tasty layers and caramelizes beautifully.
It creates a flavor-packed sheen when finished on ribs and is an
excellent consistency for dipping. Slop it on a pile of pulled pork.

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 tablespoons unsalted butter
-  1 small onion, finely chopped
-  2 cloves garlic, minced
-  2 cups tomato sauce
-  1/2 cup cider vinegar

-  2 teaspoons yellow mustard
-  1 teaspoon Louisiana hot sauce
-  1 teaspoon Kosher salt
-  1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions
----------

1. Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook
   until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant,
   about 30 seconds.
2. Add tomato sauce, cider vinegar, rice vinegar, molasses,
   Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, mustard, hot sauce, salt, black

   stirring occasionally.

   cool to room temperature, transfer to a jar and store in refrigerator
   for up to a month.
