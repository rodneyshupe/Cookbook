Ingredients
-----------

- 1 large onion 
- 1/3 cup malt vinegar 
- 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar 
- 2/3 cup water 
- 2 cups ketchup
- 2 1/2 tablespoons molasses 
- 6 oz can of Chipotle in adobo 
- 1/3 cup soy sauce 
- 1/3 cup dark brown sugar 
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 1/2 tablespoons onion powder
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder
- 1 teaspoons black pepper

Directions
----------

1. Place the all the ingredients in a heavy nonreactive saucepan and
   whisk to mix.
2. Slowly bring sauce to a boil over medium heat. Let the sauce simmer
   gently until thick and richly flavoured, about 15-20 minutes,
   whisking several times.
3. Taste for seasoning, adding more of any of the ingredients you may
   desire. Pour though a fine mesh strainer into a large measuring cup,
   press solids to extract all the liquid.  Reserve solids for another
   purpose.
4. Transfer the hot sauce to glass jars. Tightly cover the jar and let
   the sauce cool to room temperature.
5. Once the jar is opened, refrigerate the sauce; it will keep for
   several months.
