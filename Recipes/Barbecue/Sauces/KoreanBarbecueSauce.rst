Ingredients
-----------

- 1/2 cups cold water
- 1/2 cup Sprite (or other lemon-lime soda)
- 6 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons cup soy sauce
- 1/2 tablespoon Asian (dark) sesame oil
- 1 cups (about 1/2 pound) gochujang
- 1/2 tablespoon rice vinegar (or to taste (optional)

Directions
----------

1. Place the water, Sprite, sugars, and soy sauce in a heavy saucepan and
   bring to a boil over high heat. Boil until the sugars are dissolved, 3
   minutes, whisking well. Remove the pan from the heat and let cool
   slightly, then whisk in the sesame oil, gochujang, and rice vinegar, if
   using. Transfer the sauce to clean jars. Covered and kept refrigerated,
   the sauce will keep for at least 1 month.
