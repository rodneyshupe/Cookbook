In the central and southern regions of South Carolina, Mustard is king.
This golden barbecue sauce is the perfect compliment to smoked pork and
its popularity is growing as more and more people turn away from those
sticky sweet tomato sauces that line the shelves of grocery stores. This
sauce combines the mild heat of mustard with the tanginess of vinegar to
give you something incredible. This sauce works well with almost
anything, but is particularly excellent for pork.

Ingredients
-----------

-  1 1/2 cups prepared mustard
-  3/4 cups cider vinegar
-  1/2 cup brown sugar
-  3 tablespoons butter
-  3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
-  1 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice
-  1 1/2 teaspoon cyanne pepper

Directions
----------

1. Place the all the ingredients in a heavy nonreactive saucepan and
   whisk to mix. Simmer over a low heat for 30 minutes.
