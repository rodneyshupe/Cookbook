Rodney's No-Knead Bread
=======================

Based on: `Jim Lahey and Mark Bittman <https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11376-no-knead-bread>`__

Ingredients
-----------
- 425 grams all purpose or bread flour
- 1 gram (1/4 teaspoon) instant yeast
- 8-12 grams salt (I use 10 grams)
- 15 grams (1 tablespoons) distilled white vinegar
- 200 grams water (room temperature)
- 90 grams beer (allowed to warm to room temperature)

Directions
----------
1. In a large bowl whisk together flour, yeast and salt. Add liquids, and
   stir until blended; dough will be shaggy and sticky. Cover bowl with
   plastic wrap. Let dough rest at least 12 - 18 hours, at warm room
   temperature, about 70 degrees.
2. Dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles. Lightly flour a
   work surface and place dough on it; sprinkle it with a little more flour
   and fold it over on itself once or twice. Cover loosely with plastic
   wrap and let rest about 15 minutes. Using just enough flour to keep dough
   from sticking to work surface or to your fingers, gently and quickly
   shape dough into a ball. Generously coat a square of parchment paper with
   flour, wheat bran or cornmeal; transfer dough to parchment and dust with
   more flour, bran or cornmeal. Cover with cotton towel and let rise for
   about 2 hours. When it is ready, dough will be more than double in size
   and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.
3. At least a half-hour before dough is ready, heat oven to 450 degrees. Put
   a 6 to 8 quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex or ceramic)
   in oven as it heats. When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven.
   Pick up parchment and dough and lower into the pot.  Using a sharp knife
   or razor, create a slit across the top.  Cover with lid and bake
   30 minutes, then remove lid and bake another 15 to 30 minutes, until loaf
   is beautifully browned. Cool on a rack.

Variations
----------

Whole Wheat
^^^^^^^^^^^
Change Flour to 285 grams all purpose and 140 grams whole wheat.

Almost No-Knead Sourdough Bread
===============================

Source: `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/9075-sourdough-starter>`__

Ingredients
-----------
- 3 2/3 cups (18 1/3 ounces) all-purpose flour or bread flour
- 1 3/4 teaspoons salt
- 1 1/2 cups plus 4 teaspoons (12 2/3 ounces) water, room temperature
- 1/3 cup (3 ounces) mature `Sourdough Starter <#sourdough-starter>`__

Directions
----------
1. Whisk flour and salt together in medium bowl. Whisk room-temperature water
   and starter in large bowl until smooth. Add flour mixture to water mixture
   and stir using wooden spoon, scraping up dry flour from bottom of bowl
   until dough comes together, then knead by hand in bowl until shaggy ball
   forms and no dry flour remains. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sit at
   room temperature for at least 12 hours or up to 18 hours.
2. Lay 12 by 12-inch sheet of parchment paper on counter and spray generously
   with vegetable oil spray. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter and
   knead 10 to 15 times. Shape dough into ball by pulling edges into middle.
   Transfer dough, seam side down, to center of parchment. Pick up dough by
   lifting parchment edges and lower into heavy-bottomed Dutch oven. Cover
   with plastic wrap.
3. Adjust oven rack to middle position and place loaf or cake pan in bottom of
   oven. Place pot on middle rack and pour 3 cups of boiling water into pan
   below. Close oven door and let dough rise until doubled in size and does
   not readily spring back when poked with your floured finger, 2 to 3 hours.
4. Remove pot and water pan from oven; discard plastic from pot. Lightly flour
   top of dough and, using razor blade or sharp knife, make one 7-inch-long,
   1/2-inch-deep slit along top of dough. Cover pot and place on middle rack
   in oven. Heat oven to 425 degrees. Bake bread for 30 minutes (starting
   timing as soon as you turn on oven).
5. Remove lid and continue to bake until loaf is deep brown and registers
   210 degrees, 20 to 30 minutes longer. Carefully remove bread from pot;
   transfer to wire rack and let cool completely before serving.

Sourdough Starter
=================

Source: `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/9075-sourdough-starter>`__

Ingredients
-----------
- 4 1/2 cups (24 3/4 ounces) whole-wheat flour
- 5 cups (25 ounces) all-purpose flour, plus extra for maintaining starter
- Water, room temperature

Directions
----------
1. Combine whole-wheat flour and all-purpose flour in large container. Using
   wooden spoon, mix 1 cup (5 ounces) flour mixture and 2/3 cup (5 1/3 ounces)
   room-temperature water in glass bowl until no dry flour remains (reserve
   remaining flour mixture). Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room
   temperature until bubbly and fragrant, 48 to 72 hours.
2. FEED STARTER: Measure out 1/4 cup (2 ounces) starter and transfer to clean
   bowl or jar; discard remaining starter. Stir 1/2 cup (2 1/2 ounces) flour
   mixture and 1/4 cup (2 ounces) room-temperature water into starter until
   no dry flour remains. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room
   temperature for 24 hours.
3. Repeat step 2 every 24 hours until starter is pleasantly aromatic and
   doubles in size 8 to 12 hours after being fed, 10 to 14 days. At this point
   starter is mature and ready to be baked with, or it can be moved to storage.
   (If baking, use starter once it has doubled in size during 8-to-12-hour
   window. Use starter within 1 hour after it starts to deflate once reaching
   its peak.)
4. TO STORE AND MAINTAIN MATURE STARTER: Measure out 1/4 cup (2 ounces)
   starter and transfer to clean bowl; discard remaining starter. Stir
   1/2 cup (2 1/2 ounces) all-purpose flour and 1/4 cup (2 ounces)
   room-temperature water into starter until no dry flour remains. Transfer
   to clean container that can be loosely covered (plastic container or mason
   jar with its lid inverted) and let sit at room temperature for 5 hours.
   Cover and transfer to refrigerator. If not baking regularly, repeat
   process weekly.
5. TO PREPARE FOR BAKING: Eighteen to 24 hours before baking, measure out
   1/2 cup (4 ounces) starter and transfer to clean bowl; discard remaining
   starter. Stir 1 cup (5 ounces) all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup (4 ounces)
   room-temperature water into starter until no dry flour remains. Cover and
   let sit at room temperature for 5 hours. Measure out amount of starter
   called for in bread recipe and transfer to second bowl. Cover and
   refrigerate for at least 12 hours or up to 18 hours. Remaining starter
   should be refrigerated and maintained as directed.

Simple Crusty Bread
===================

Source: `NY Times <https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018203-simple-crusty-bread>`_

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 1/2 tablespoons yeast
- 1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt
- 6 1/2 cups unbleached, all-purpose flour, more for dusting dough
- Cornmeal

Directions
----------

1. In a large bowl or plastic container, mix yeast and salt into 3 cups
   lukewarm water (about 100 degrees). Stir in flour, mixing until there are
   no dry patches. Dough will be quite loose. Cover, but not with an airtight
   lid. Let dough rise at room temperature 2 hours (or up to 5 hours).
2. Bake at this point or refrigerate, covered, for as long as two weeks. When
   ready to bake, sprinkle a little flour on dough and cut off a
   grapefruit-size piece with serrated knife. Turn dough in hands to lightly
   stretch surface, creating a rounded top and a lumpy bottom. Put dough on
   pizza peel sprinkled with cornmeal; let rest 40 minutes. Repeat with
   remaining dough or refrigerate it.
3. Place broiler pan on bottom of oven. Place baking stone on middle rack and
   turn oven to 450 degrees; heat stone at that temperature for 20 minutes.
4. Dust dough with flour, slash top with serrated or very sharp knife three
   times. Slide onto stone. Pour one cup hot water into broiler pan and shut
   oven quickly to trap steam. Bake until well browned, about 30 minutes.
   Cool completely.

Variation
---------

If not using stone, stretch rounded dough into oval and place in a greased,
nonstick loaf pan. Let rest 40 minutes if fresh, an extra hour if
refrigerated. Heat oven to 450 degrees for 5 minutes. Place pan on middle
rack.

60-Minute Bread
===============

Source: The Minimalist Cooks Dinner by Mark Bittman

Ingredients
-----------

- 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed
- 2 teaspoons instant yeast, such as SAF
- 2 teaspoons salt

Directions
----------

1. Combine the flour, yeast, and salt in a bowl or food processor. Add
   1 1/4 cups warm water all at once, stirring with a wooden spoon or
   mixing with the machine on. Continue to mix, for a minute or two longer
   by hand, about 30 seconds total with the food processor. Add additional
   water by the tablespoon if necessary, until a ball forms.
2. Shape the dough into a flat round or long loaf, adding only enough flour
   to allow you to handle the dough. Place the dough on a baking sheet or a
   well-floured pizza peel. Let it rise in the warmest place in your
   kitchen, covered, while you preheat the oven to 425°F. (If you have time,
   let it rise for an hour or so.)
3. Bake the bread on a sheet, or slide it onto a baking stone. Bake until
   done, 30 to 45 minutes; the crust will be golden-brown, crisp, and firm.

Easy No-Knead Focaccia
======================

Source: `Bon Appetit <https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/easy-no-knead-focaccia>`__

Ingredients
-----------
- 1 1/4-oz. (8g) envelope active dry yeast (about 2 1/4 tsp.)
- 2 tsp. honey
- 5 cups (625 g) all-purpose flour
- 5 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 Tbsp. Morton kosher salt
- 6 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more for hands
- 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, plus more for pan
- Flaky sea salt
- 2 garlic cloves

Directions
----------
1. Whisk one envelope active dry yeast, honey, and 2 1/2 cups lukewarm water
   in a medium bowl and let sit 5 minutes (it should foam or at least get
   creamy; if it doesn’t your yeast is dead and you should start again—check
   the expiration date!).
2. Add flour and salt and mix with a rubber spatula until a shaggy dough
   forms and no dry streaks remain.
3. Pour 4 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil into a large bowl. Transfer dough to
   bowl and turn to coat in oil. Cover with lid or plastic wrap and chill in
   refrigerator until dough is doubled in size (it should look very bubbly
   and alive), at least 8 hours and up to 1 day. If you're in a rush, you
   can also let it rise at room temperature until doubled in size, 3–4 hours.
4. Spray a 13x9" baking pan then pour 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil into
   center of pan. Keeping the dough in the bowl and using a fork in each
   hand, gather up edges of dough farthest from you and lift up and over
   into center of bowl. Give the bowl a quarter turn and repeat process. Do
   this 2 more times; you want to deflate dough while you form it into a
   rough ball. Transfer dough to prepared pan. Pour any oil left in bowl
   over and turn dough to coat it in oil. Let rise, uncovered, in a dry,
   warm spot until doubled in size, at least 1 1/2 hours and up to 4 hours.
5. Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 450°. To see if the dough is
   ready, poke it with your finger. It should spring back slowly, leaving a
   small visible indentation. If it springs back quickly, the dough isn’t
   ready. (If at this point the dough is ready to bake but you aren’t, you
   can chill it up to 1 hour.) Lightly oil your hands. Gently stretch out
   dough to fill baking pan, if needed. Dimple focaccia all over with your
   fingers, like you’re aggressively playing the piano, creating very deep
   depressions in the dough (reach your fingers all the way to the bottom
   of the pan). Drizzle with remaining 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil and
   sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Bake focaccia until puffed and golden
   brown all over, 20–30 minutes.
6. Hold off on this last step until you're ready to serve the focaccia:
   Melt 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.
   Remove from heat. Peel and grate in garlic cloves with a Microplane.
   Return to medium heat and cook, stirring often, until garlic is just
   lightly toasted, 30–45 seconds. (Or, if you prefer raw garlic to
   toasted garlic, you can grate the garlic into the hot butter, off
   heat, then brush right away.)
7. Brush garlic-butter all over focaccia and slice into squares or
   rectangles.

Note
----

Variation: The called for 13x9" baking pan creates a thicker focaccia
that’s perfect for sandwiches. Alternatively use a 18x13" rimmed baking
sheet, for focaccia that's thinner, crispier, and great for snacking.

Make Ahead: Focaccia is best eaten the day it's made, but keeps well in the
freezer. Slice it into pieces, store it in a freezer-safe container, then
reheat it on a baking sheet in a 300° F oven.

Dinner Rolls
============

Ingredients
-----------

Flour Paste
^^^^^^^^^^^
- 1/2 cup water
- 3 tablespoons bread flour

Dough
^^^^^
- 1/2 cup cold milk
- 1 large egg
- 2 cups (11 ounces) bread flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons instant or rapid-rise yeast
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, plus 1/2 tablespoon, melted

Directions
----------

1. FOR THE FLOUR PASTE: Whisk water and flour together in small bowl until
   no lumps remain. Microwave, whisking every 20 seconds, until mixture
   thickens to stiff, smooth, pudding-like consistency that forms mound when
   dropped from end of whisk into bowl, 40 to 80 seconds.
2. FOR THE DOUGH: In bowl of stand mixer, whisk flour paste and milk
   together until smooth. Add egg and whisk until incorporated. Add flour
   and yeast. Fit stand mixer with dough hook and mix on low speed until all
   flour is moistened, 1 to 2 minutes. Let stand for 15 minutes.
3. Add sugar and salt and mix on medium-low speed for 5 minutes. With mixer
   running, add softened butter, 1 tablespoon at a time. Continue to mix on
   medium-low speed 5 minutes longer, scraping down dough hook and sides of
   bowl occasionally (dough will stick to bottom of bowl).
4. Transfer dough to very lightly floured counter. Knead briefly to form
   ball and transfer, seam side down, to lightly greased bowl; lightly coat
   surface of dough with vegetable oil spray and cover with plastic wrap.
   Let rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
5. Grease 9-inch round cake pan and set aside. Transfer dough to counter.
   Press dough gently but firmly to expel all air. Pat and stretch dough to
   form 8 by 9-inch rectangle with short side facing you. Cut dough
   lengthwise into 4 equal strips and cut each strip crosswise into 3 equal
   pieces. Working with 1 piece at a time, stretch and press dough gently to
   form 8 by 2-inch strip. Starting on short side, roll dough to form snug
   cylinder and arrange shaped rolls seam side down in prepared pan, placing
   10 rolls around edge of pan, pointing inward, and remaining 2 rolls in
   center. Cover with plastic and let rise until doubled, 45 minutes to
   1 hour.
6. When rolls are nearly doubled, adjust oven rack to lowest position and
   heat oven to 375 degrees. Bake rolls until deep golden brown,
   25 to 30 minutes. Let rolls cool in pan on wire rack for 3 minutes;
   invert rolls onto rack, then reinvert. Brush tops and sides of rolls with
   melted butter. Let rolls cool for at least 20 minutes before serving.

Basic Flatbread
===============

Ingredients
-----------

- 300 grams flour, any wheat sort (white, wholemeal even SR or plain/all-purpose)
- 3/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 180 grams cold water.

Directions
----------

1. Add flour, baking powder, and salt to food processor and lock lid into
   place. Turn on processor and process until combined, about 5 seconds. Stop
   processor and remove lid. Add oil and lock lid back into place. Process
   until no visible streaks of oil remain, about 10 seconds.
2. With processor running, slowly pour water through feed tube and process
   until dough forms soft ball that clears sides of processor bowl, 30 to 60
   seconds. Stop processor, remove lid, and carefully remove processor blade.
3. Sprinkle clean counter with extra flour and coat your hands in flour.
   Transfer dough to counter, knead for 30 seconds, then form dough into
   smooth ball.
4. Use bench scraper to divide dough into 4 equal pieces. Working with
   1 piece of dough at a time, shape dough into ball (click here to learn
   how to shape dough into balls). Repeat with remaining pieces of dough.
   Cover dough balls loosely with plastic wrap. Let sit for 30 minutes.
5. When dough is ready, sprinkle extra flour on clean counter. Use your
   fingertips to gently pat 1 dough ball into 5-inch circle (keep remaining
   dough balls covered). Use rolling pin to roll dough into 9-inch circle,
   flouring counter as needed to prevent sticking. Repeat rolling with
   remaining dough balls.
6. Heat 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat for 3 minutes (skillet
   should be hot but not smoking).
7. Gently prick 1 dough round all over with fork, then carefully place in
   skillet (ask an adult for help). Cook until underside is spotty brown,
   1 to 2 minutes. Use spatula to carefully flip dough round and cook until
   second side is spotty brown, 1 to 2 minutes.
8. Use spatula to carefully transfer flatbread to plate and cover with clean
   dish towel to keep warm. Repeat with remaining dough rounds, stacking
   flatbreads and re-covering with towel as they finish. Serve warm.

Variations
----------
* Naan: substitute 340 grams greek yogurt for the oil and water.
* Garlic Naan: Substitute yogurt as above. Then when cooking, once the first
  side of the naan is cooked, flip the naan over and brush the cooked side
  with olive oil, sprinkle with about 1/4 teaspoon of cilantro and
  1/4 teaspoon of garlic. When the second side is cooked, flip the garlic
  side onto the griddle surface for just a few seconds. The hot surface will
  help seal the garlic to the naan.
* Sesame Nann: Substitute yogurt as above. Then when cooking, brush with a
  little olive oil when the naan is done cooking and sprinkle 1 side with
  sesame seeds. Place the sesame seed side of the naan onto the cooking
  surface for just a few seconds to seal the sesame seeds into the surface
  of the naan.

Pita Bread
==========

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet or 8 grams)
- 1/2 teaspoon sugar
- 35 grams whole-wheat flour (1/4 cup), preferably freshly milled
- 310 grams unbleached all-purposed flour (2 1/2 cups)
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions
----------

1. Make sponge: Put 1 cup lukewarm water in a large mixing bowl. Add yeast
   and sugar. Stir to dissolve. Add the whole-wheat flour and
   1/4 cup all-purpose flour and whisk together. Put bowl in a warm (not hot)
   place, uncovered, until mixture is frothy and bubbling, about 15 minutes.
2. Add salt, olive oil and nearly all remaining all-purpose flour (reserve
   1/2 cup). With a wooden spoon or a pair of chopsticks, stir until mixture
   forms a shaggy mass. Dust with a little reserved flour, then knead in bowl
   for 1 minute, incorporating any stray bits of dry dough.
3. Turn dough onto work surface. Knead lightly for 2 minutes, until smooth.
   Cover and let rest 10 minutes, then knead again for 2 minutes. Try not to
   add too much reserved flour; the dough should be soft and a bit moist. (At
   this point, dough may refrigerated in a large zippered plastic bag for
   several hours or overnight. Bring dough back to room temperature, knead
   into a ball and proceed with recipe.)
4. Clean the mixing bowl and put dough back in it. Cover bowl tightly with
   plastic wrap, then cover with a towel. Put bowl in a warm (not hot) place.
   Leave until dough has doubled in size, about 1 hour.
5. Heat oven to 475 degrees. On bottom shelf of oven, place a heavy-duty
   baking sheet, large cast-iron pan or ceramic baking tile. Punch down dough
   and divide into 8 pieces of equal size. Form each piece into a little
   ball. Place dough balls on work surface, cover with a damp towel and leave
   for 10 minutes.
6. Remove 1 ball (keeping others covered) and press into a flat diskc with
   rolling pin. Roll to a 6-inch circle, then to an 8-inch diameter, about
   1/8 inch thick, dusting with flour if necessary. (The dough will shrink
   a bit while baking.)
7. Carefully lift the dough circle and place quickly on hot baking sheet.
   After 2 minutes the dough should be nicely puffed. Turn over with tongs
   or spatula and bake 1 minute more. The pita should be pale, with only a
   few brown speckles. Transfer warm pita to a napkin-lined basket and cover
   so bread stays soft. Repeat with the rest of the dough balls.
