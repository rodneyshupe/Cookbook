Pan-Seared Thick-Cut Strip Steaks
=================================

+----------------------+--------------------------+-------------------+
| Prep Time: 5 minutes | Cooking Time: 35 minutes | Yield: 4 servings |
+----------------------+--------------------------+-------------------+

Source: `Cooks
Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/3564-pan-seared-thick-cut-strip-steaks>`__

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 boneless strip steaks (1 1/2 to 1 3/4 inches thick (about 1 pound
   each) (see note above)
-  Kosher salt and ground black pepper
-  1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 275°F. Pat
   steaks dry with paper towel. Cut each steak in half vertically to
   create four 8-ounce steaks. Season entire surface of steaks liberally
   with salt and pepper; gently press sides of steaks until uniform 1
   1/2 inches thick. Place steaks on wire rack set in rimmed baking
   sheet; transfer baking sheet to oven. Cook until instant-read
   thermometer inserted in center of steak registers 90 to 95°F
   for rare to medium-rare, 20 to 25 minutes, or 100 to 105°F for
   medium, 25 to 30 minutes.
2. Heat oil in 12-inch heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat until
   smoking. Place steaks in skillet and sear steaks until well-browned
   and crusty, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, lifting once halfway through to
   redistribute fat underneath each steak. (Reduce heat if fond begins
   to burn.) Using tongs, turn steaks and cook until well browned on
   second side, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Transfer all steaks to wire cooling
   rack and reduce heat under pan to medium. Use tongs to stand 2 steaks
   on their sides. Holding steaks together, return to skillet and sear
   on all sides until browned, about 1 1/2 minutes. Repeat with
   remaining 2 steaks.
3. Transfer steaks to wire cooling rack and let rest, loosely tented
   with foil, for 10 minutes while preparing pan sauce. Arrange steaks
   on individual plates and spoon sauce over steaks; serve immediately.

Notes
-----

-  Rib-eye or filet mignon of similar thickness can be substituted for
   strip steaks. If using filet mignon, buying a 2-pound center-cut
   tenderloin roast and portioning it into four 8-ounce steaks yourself
   will produce more consistent results. If using filet mignon, increase
   the oven time by about 5 minutes.
-  When cooking lean strip steaks (without an external fat cap) or filet
   mignon, add an extra tablespoon of oil to the pan.
-  If desired, serve with a pan sauce, relish, or butter; see related
   recipes.

Prime Rib
=========

+--------------------------------------+-------------------------------+------------------------+
| Prep Time: 5 minutes + 24 - 96 hours | Cooking Time: 4 1/2 - 6 hours | Yield: 6 TO 8 servings |
+--------------------------------------+-------------------------------+------------------------+

Source: `Cooks
Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/6843-best-prime-rib>`__


Ingredients
-----------

- 1 (7-pound) first-cut beef standing rib roast (3 bones), meat removed from
  bones, bones reserved
- Kosher salt and ground black pepper
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil

Directions
----------

1. Using sharp knife, cut slits in surface layer of fat, spaced 1 inch apart,
   in crosshatch pattern, being careful to cut down to, but not into, meat.
   Rub 2 tablespoons salt over entire roast and into slits. Place meat back
   on bones (to save space in refrigerator), transfer to large plate, and
   refrigerate, uncovered, at least 24 hours and up to 96 hours.
2. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200°F. Heat oil
   in 12-inch skillet over high heat until just smoking. Sear sides and top
   of roast (reserving bone) until browned, 6 to 8 minutes total (do not sear
   side where roast was cut from bone). Place meat back on ribs, so bones fit
   where they were cut, and let cool for 10 minutes; tie meat to bones with
   2 lengths of twine between ribs. Transfer roast, fat side up, to wire rack
   set in rimmed baking sheet and season with pepper. Roast until meat
   registers 110°F, 3 to 4 hours.
3. Turn off oven; leave roast in oven, opening door as little as possible,
   until meat registers about 120°F for rare or about 125°F for
   medium-rare, 30 to 75 minutes longer.
4. Remove roast from oven (leave roast on baking sheet), tent loosely with
   aluminum foil, and let rest for at least 30 minutes and up to 75 minutes.
5. Adjust oven rack about 8 inches from broiler element and heat broiler.
   Remove foil from roast, form into 3-inch ball, and place under ribs to
   elevate fat cap. Broil until top of roast is well browned and crisp,
   2 to 8 minutes.
6. Transfer roast to carving board; cut twine and remove roast from ribs.
   Slice meat into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Season with coarse salt to taste,
   and serve.

Note
----
- Look for a roast with an untrimmed fat cap (ideally ½ inch thick).
- To remove the bones from the roast, use a sharp knife and run it down the
  length of the bones, following the contours as closely as possible until
  the meat is separated.

Soy-Braised Short Ribs
======================

+-----------------------------------+------------------------+-----------------------+
| Prep Time: 30 minutes + overnight | Cooking Time: ~6 hours | Yield: 6 - 8 servings |
+-----------------------------------+------------------------+-----------------------+

Source: `Salt Fat Acid Heat <https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/salt/soy-braised-short-ribs>`__

Ingredients
-----------
- 5 pounds meaty short ribs on the bone, 2-3 inches thick
- Salt
- Neutral tasting oil, such as canola or grapeseed
- 1/4 cup (60 grams) soy sauce
- 1/4 cup (55 grams) dark brown sugar
- 1/4 cup (58 grams) mirin (rice wine)
- 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger
- 4 garlic cloves, finely grated or pounded with a pinch of salt
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne
- About 1 cup (228 grams) dashi
- 1/4 cup coarsely chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems
- 4 scallions, green and white parts slivered

Directions
----------
1. Prep the ribs the day before you want to cook. Season the meat lightly
   with salt and let it sit for 30 minutes. Keep in mind that the marinade
   consists mostly of soy sauce, which is salty, so use only about half as
   much salt as you otherwise would.
2. In the meantime, whisk together the soy sauce, brown sugar, mirin,
   sesame oil, ginger, garlic, and cayenne. Place the meat in a resealable
   plastic bag and pour in the marinade. Seal the bag and squish the
   marinade around so all the meat is evenly coated. Refrigerate overnight.
3. A few hours before you want to cook the ribs, pull them out of the
   fridge to come up to room temperature. Adjust oven rack to middle
   position and preheat to 400°F.
4. Set a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat to preheat. When pan
   is hot, drop the temperature to medium-low, add just enough oil to coat
   the bottom. Working in batches so as not to crowd pan, brown a few short
   ribs at a time on all three meaty sides, adding more oil if necessary
   before each batch. Reduce heat as necessary to achieve browning
   gradually; it may take 4 to 5 minutes per side for well-browned ribs.
5. Transfer the ribs, bone-side down, to a large Dutch oven or a large,
   deep ceramic or pyrex roasting dish, then pour the marinade over the
   meat.  It’s fine if the ribs are snug, but they should all fit in a
   single layer. Add enough dashi to go about ¾-inch up the sides of the
   ribs, then cover with lid or parchment and aluminum foil. Slide into the
   oven and cook until the liquid simmers, about 30 minutes, then reduce
   heat to 325°F and cook until meat is very tender and falling off the
   bone, 3 to 4 hours more.
6. Uncover pot or dish and crank oven to 450°F. Brush ribs with the braising
   juices and cook for about until shiny and brown, about 8 to 12 minutes.
7. Serve warm, garnished with cilantro and slivered scallions.

Making Dashi
------------
1. Place water and 6" piece of kombu in a medium saucepan and set over
   medium-high heat. Just before the water comes to a boil, remove the kombu
   and discard. Add the a handful (1/2 cup) of dried bonito shavings and simmer
   for 8 minutes, then turn off heat and let stand 8 minutes.
2. Pour the dashi through a fine-mesh strainer set in a 2- or 4-cup measuring
   cup. You should have 1 1/3 cups (304 grams) dashi. If you do not, add water
   (pouring through the strainer holding the strained katsuobushi) to make the
   amount of liquid needed. Keep chilled in the fridge, use within a day or so.

   and Boursin together in bowl until hot, about 1 minute, then gently
   fold into potatoes. Fold chives, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon

Nedimaki (Japanese Grilled Steak and Green Onion Rolls)
=======================================================

Source: `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/11173-japanese-grilled-steak-and-scallion-rolls-negimaki>`__

Serves: 4 as main dish, or 8 as appitizer

Ingredients
-----------
- 1 (2-pound) flank steak, trimmed
- 1/2 cup soy sauce
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 3 tablespoons mirin
- 3 tablespoons sake
- 16 green onions, trimmed and halved crosswise
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds, toasted

Directions
----------

1. Place steak on large plate and freeze until firm, about 30 minutes.
2. Bring soy sauce, sugar, mirin, and sake to simmer in small saucepan over
   high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Reduce heat to medium and cook
   until slightly syrupy and reduced to 1/2 cup, 3 to 5 minutes. Divide
   evenly between 2 bowls and let cool. Cover 1 bowl with plastic wrap and
   set aside for serving.
3. Place steak on cutting board. Starting at narrow, tapered end, slice
   steak 3/8-inch thick on bias against grain until width of steak is
   7 inches (depending on size of steak, you will need to remove
   2 to 3 slices until steak measures 7 inches across). Cut steak in half
   lengthwise. Continue to slice each half on bias against grain. You should
   have at least 24 slices. Pound each slice to 3/16-inch thickness between
   2 sheets of plastic.
4. Arrange 3 slices on cutting board with short side of slices facing you,
   overlapping slices by 1/4 inch and alternating tapered ends as needed, to
   form rough rectangle that measures 4 to 6 inches wide and at least
   4 inches long. Place 4 scallion halves along edge of rectangle nearest
   to edge of counter, with white tips slightly hanging over edges of steak
   on either side. Starting from bottom edge and rolling away from you,
   roll into tight cylinder. Insert 3 equally spaced toothpicks into end
   flaps and through center of roll. Transfer roll to platter and repeat
   with remaining steak and scallions. (Assembled rolls can be refrigerated
   for up to 24 hours.)
5. For a Gas Grill: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until
   hot, about 15 minutes. Leave all burners on high.
6. Clean and oil cooking grate. Place rolls on grill (over coals if using
   charcoal) and cook until first side is beginning to char, 4 to 6 minutes.
   Flip rolls, brush cooked side with glaze, and cook until second side is
   beginning to char, 4 to 6 minutes. Cook remaining 2 sides, glazing after
   each turn, until all 4 sides of rolls are evenly charred and thermometer
   inserted from end of roll into scallions at core registers
   150 to 155 degrees, 16 to 24 minutes total. Transfer rolls to cutting
   board, tent with aluminum foil, and let rest for 5 minutes. Discard
   remaining glaze.
7. Remove toothpicks from rolls and cut rolls crosswise into 3/4-inch-long
   pieces. Arrange rolls cut side down on clean platter, drizzle with
   2 tablespoons reserved glaze, sprinkle with sesame seeds, and serve,
   passing remaining reserved glaze separately.

Italian Meatballs
=================

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 slices white sandwich bread (crusts discarded), torn into small cubes
- 1/2 cup buttermilk or 6 tablespoons plain yogurt thinned with 2 tablespoons sweet milk
- 3/4 pound ground beef chuck ( or 1 pound if omitting ground pork below)
- 1/4 pound ground pork (to be mixed with ground chuck)
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves
- 1 large egg yolk
- 1 small clove garlic, minced (1 teaspoon)
- 3/4 teaspoon table salt
- Ground black pepper
- Vegetable oil for pan-frying (about 1 1/4 cups)

Directions
----------

1. Combine bread and buttermilk in small bowl, mashing occasionally with fork,
   until smooth paste forms, about 10 minutes.
2. Mix all meatball ingredients, including bread mixture and pepper to taste
   in medium bowl. Lightly form 3 tablespoons of mixture into 1 1/2-inch
   round meatballs; repeat with remaining mixture to form approximately
   14 meatballs. (Compacting them can make the meatballs dense and hard. Can
   be placed on large plate, covered loosely with plastic wrap, and
   refrigerated for several hours.)
3. Meanwhile, heat 1/4 -inch vegetable oil over medium-high heat in
   10- or 11-inch sauté pan. When edge of meatball dipped in oil sizzles, add
   meatballs in single layer. Fry, turning several times, until nicely
   browned on all sides, about 10 minutes, regulating heat as needed to keep
   oil sizzling but not smoking. Transfer browned meatballs to paper towel
   lined plate; set aside. Repeat, if necessary, with remaining meatballs.

Notes
-----
- When cooking the meatballs you can use less oil and a non stick pan.  Use
  about 3-4 tablespoons of vegtable oil in the pan.
- Serve with `Simple Tomato Sauce <#simple-tomato-sauce>`__ alone or on
  spaghitti with or without `Garlic Bread <#garlic-bread>`__.
