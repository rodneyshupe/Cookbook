- 2 tablespoons minced shallots
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh chives
- 1 garlic clove, minced

2. Adjust oven rack to middle position, place 12-inch cast-iron skillet on
   rack, and heat oven to 500°F. Combine butter, shallot, parsley,

Pan-Seared Thick-Cut Strip Steaks
=================================

+----------------------+--------------------------+-------------------+
| Prep Time: 5 minutes | Cooking Time: 35 minutes | Yield: 4 servings |
+----------------------+--------------------------+-------------------+

Source: `Cooks
Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/3564-pan-seared-thick-cut-strip-steaks>`__

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 boneless strip steaks (1 1/2 to 1 3/4 inches thick (about 1 pound
   each) (see note above)
-  Kosher salt and ground black pepper
-  1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 275°F. Pat
   steaks dry with paper towel. Cut each steak in half vertically to
   create four 8-ounce steaks. Season entire surface of steaks liberally
   with salt and pepper; gently press sides of steaks until uniform 1
   1/2 inches thick. Place steaks on wire rack set in rimmed baking
   sheet; transfer baking sheet to oven. Cook until instant-read
   thermometer inserted in center of steak registers 90 to 95°F
   for rare to medium-rare, 20 to 25 minutes, or 100 to 105°F for
   medium, 25 to 30 minutes.
2. Heat oil in 12-inch heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat until
   smoking. Place steaks in skillet and sear steaks until well-browned
   and crusty, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, lifting once halfway through to
   redistribute fat underneath each steak. (Reduce heat if fond begins
   to burn.) Using tongs, turn steaks and cook until well browned on
   second side, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Transfer all steaks to wire cooling
   rack and reduce heat under pan to medium. Use tongs to stand 2 steaks
   on their sides. Holding steaks together, return to skillet and sear
   on all sides until browned, about 1 1/2 minutes. Repeat with
   remaining 2 steaks.
3. Transfer steaks to wire cooling rack and let rest, loosely tented
   with foil, for 10 minutes while preparing pan sauce. Arrange steaks
   on individual plates and spoon sauce over steaks; serve immediately.

Notes
-----

-  Rib-eye or filet mignon of similar thickness can be substituted for
   strip steaks. If using filet mignon, buying a 2-pound center-cut
   tenderloin roast and portioning it into four 8-ounce steaks yourself
   will produce more consistent results. If using filet mignon, increase
   the oven time by about 5 minutes.
-  When cooking lean strip steaks (without an external fat cap) or filet
   mignon, add an extra tablespoon of oil to the pan.
-  If desired, serve with a pan sauce, relish, or butter; see related
   recipes.

| Prep Time: 5 minutes + 24 - 96 hours | Cooking Time: 4 1/2 - 6 hours | Yield: 6 TO 8 servings |
+--------------------------------------+-------------------------------+------------------------+

Source: `Cooks
Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/6843-best-prime-rib>`__


Ingredients
-----------

- 1 (7-pound) first-cut beef standing rib roast (3 bones), meat removed from
  bones, bones reserved
- Kosher salt and ground black pepper
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil

Directions
----------

1. Using sharp knife, cut slits in surface layer of fat, spaced 1 inch apart,
   in crosshatch pattern, being careful to cut down to, but not into, meat.
   Rub 2 tablespoons salt over entire roast and into slits. Place meat back
   on bones (to save space in refrigerator), transfer to large plate, and
   refrigerate, uncovered, at least 24 hours and up to 96 hours.
2. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200°F. Heat oil
   in 12-inch skillet over high heat until just smoking. Sear sides and top
   of roast (reserving bone) until browned, 6 to 8 minutes total (do not sear
   side where roast was cut from bone). Place meat back on ribs, so bones fit
   where they were cut, and let cool for 10 minutes; tie meat to bones with
   2 lengths of twine between ribs. Transfer roast, fat side up, to wire rack
   set in rimmed baking sheet and season with pepper. Roast until meat
   registers 110°F, 3 to 4 hours.
3. Turn off oven; leave roast in oven, opening door as little as possible,
   until meat registers about 120°F for rare or about 125°F for
   medium-rare, 30 to 75 minutes longer.
4. Remove roast from oven (leave roast on baking sheet), tent loosely with
   aluminum foil, and let rest for at least 30 minutes and up to 75 minutes.
5. Adjust oven rack about 8 inches from broiler element and heat broiler.
   Remove foil from roast, form into 3-inch ball, and place under ribs to
   elevate fat cap. Broil until top of roast is well browned and crisp,
   2 to 8 minutes.
6. Transfer roast to carving board; cut twine and remove roast from ribs.
   Slice meat into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Season with coarse salt to taste,
   and serve.

Note
----
- Look for a roast with an untrimmed fat cap (ideally ½ inch thick).
- To remove the bones from the roast, use a sharp knife and run it down the
  length of the bones, following the contours as closely as possible until
  the meat is separated.

   in medium bowl. Lightly form 3 tablespoons of mixture into 1 1/2-inch
   round meatballs; repeat with remaining mixture to form approximately
   14 meatballs. (Compacting them can make the meatballs dense and hard. Can
   be placed on large plate, covered loosely with plastic wrap, and
   refrigerated for several hours.)
3. Meanwhile, heat 1/4 -inch vegetable oil over medium-high heat in
   10- or 11-inch sauté pan. When edge of meatball dipped in oil sizzles, add
   meatballs in single layer. Fry, turning several times, until nicely
   browned on all sides, about 10 minutes, regulating heat as needed to keep
   oil sizzling but not smoking. Transfer browned meatballs to paper towel
   lined plate; set aside. Repeat, if necessary, with remaining meatballs.

Notes
-----
- When cooking the meatballs you can use less oil and a non stick pan.  Use
  about 3-4 tablespoons of vegtable oil in the pan.
- Serve with `Simple Tomato Sauce <#simple-tomato-sauce>`__ alone or on
  spaghitti with or without `Garlic Bread <#garlic-bread>`__.
