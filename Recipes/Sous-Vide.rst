Glazed Carrots
==============

You’ll never eat a more carrot-y carrot.

+-----------------------+--------------------+---------------+------------+
| Prep Time: 10 minutes | Total Time: 1 hour | Servings: 4-6 | Temp 183°F |
+-----------------------+--------------------+---------------+------------+


Ingredients
-----------

-  1 pound baby whole baby carrots, peeled or well-scrubbed, or 1 pound
   medium to large carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
-  2 tablespoons (30g) unsalted butter
-  1 tablespoon (12g) granulated sugar
-  Kosher salt
-  Freshly ground black pepper
-  1 tablespoon (15ml) chopped flat leaf parsley (optional)


Directions
----------

1. Preheat sous-vide cooker to 183°F. Place carrots, butter, sugar, and
   1/2 teaspoon kosher salt in a vacuum bag and seal according to
   manufacturer’s instructions. Cook carrots in the water bath until
   fully tender, about 1 hour. At this point, carrots can be stored in
   refrigerator for up to 1 week.
2. empty entire contents of bag into a 12-inch, heavy-bottomed skillet
   and cook over high heat, stirring constantly, until liquid has
   reduced to a shiny glaze, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt
   and pepper, stir in parsley, and serve. If glaze breaks and turns
   greasy, add water a teaspoon at a time, shaking pan to re-form glaze.


Make Ahead
----------

After step 1 quick chill the pouch, submerged in ice water (half
ice/half water) for 15 to 20 minutes and refrigerate up to 1 week. To
server reheat in water bath with protein and continue with Step 2.


Variations
----------

The following vegetables will do equally well with the exact same
recipe: \* Small onions (like cipollini or pearl onions), peeled. \*
Small radishes, scrubbed of dirt, stems trimmed to 1/4-inch, or large
radishes, cut into 1-inch pieces. \* Small turnips, peeled, stems
trimmed to 1/4-inch, or large turnips, cut into 1-inch pieces. \*
Parsnips, peeled, and cut into 1-inch pieces. \* Baby artichokes,
trimmed and quartered.

Why this works
--------------

-  at 183°F, carrots will soften but not turn mushy.
-  Cooking carrots sous-vide cooks them in their own juices, packing
   them with intense carrot flavor.
-  Tossing the carrots in the skillet for a couple minutes after cooking
   glazes them in their reduced juices, enhancing their flavor and
   appearance


Make Ahead
----------

Quick chill the pouch, submerged in ice water (half ice/half water) for
15 to 20 minutes and refrigerate until ready to reheat alongside meat or
fish in the water oven.

Creme Brulee
============

+-----------------------+--------------+--------------------+------------+
| Prep Time: 15 minutes | Cook: 1 hour | Total: 5 1/2 hours | Temp 183°F |
+-----------------------+--------------+--------------------+------------+

Source: `Avona
Culinary <https://recipes.anovaculinary.com/recipe/sous-vide-ultimate-creme-brulee-with-variations>`__


Ingredients
-----------

-  2 cups heavy whipping cream
-  4 large egg yolks
-  1/4 cups granulated sugar
-  1/4 tsp salt
-  seeds from one vanilla bean (you can substitute 1 tsp pure vanilla
   extract or 1/2 teaspoon ground vanilla)
-  Topping/Garnish: berries, chocolate chips, crystallized ginger, mint
   leaves


Directions
----------

1. Set your sous-vide to 183°F (83°C)
2. In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine the egg yolks, sugar, and salt
   and whisk until pale and well-combined. Set aside.
3. Pour the heavy cream into a small saucepan with deep sides and place
   over medium-high heat, bringing only to a simmer. Once the cream is
   heated, add flavoring. *For basic creme brulee, stick with the
   vanilla alone. Otherwise, choose any of the listed options (or even
   try others of your own)*
4. Simmer lowly for 3 - 4 minutes. Remove pan from the heat, and after
   allowing to cool for a couple of minutes, pour a small amount (1/4
   cup or so) of the cream through a fine-mesh sieve or strainer into
   the yolks to temper them. Whisk to combine, and then continue the
   straining and whisking process with the rest of the cream.
5. Divide the mixture evenly between four 4 ounce (or two 8 ounce) mason
   jars with two-part screw-top lids. Attach the lids and screw shut to
   “fingertip tightness”, the variable of “closed-ness” achieved by
   using only your fingertips to screw on the lids.
6. Place the jars into the bath. Cover the vessel with Saran Wrap and
   set the timer for 1 hour.
7. Remove the jars from the bath and dry off with a towel. Allow to cool
   for a few minutes on the countertop before putting in the
   refrigerator for a minimum of 4 hours. They will keep in the fridge
   for up to 5 days.
8. When you are ready to consume, take out of the refrigerator and
   remove the lid. If the surface is not smooth, this can be remedied by
   grazing the surface with the back of a heated spoon (as in dipped in
   hot water).
9. Sprinkle 1/2 tsp - 1 tsp sugar on the top of each custard. Caramelize
   with a blow torch or underneath a preheated broiler.

Flavour Variations:
-------------------

-  1 tbsp Ameretto
-  2 tsp Kahlua
-  1 tbsp citrus zest of your choosing: lemon, lime, orange, etc.
-  1 tbsp fresh ginger
-  1/4 tsp flavor extract such as almond, peppermint, anise, orange, etc
-  sprig of herb such as: fresh basil, thyme, rosemary, mint, tarragon
-  pinch spices: saffron, pumpkin pie spice, nutmeg, ground ginger
-  1 tsp Florals: rose water or orange blossom water
-  1 earl Grey tea bag
-  fresh or dried bay leaves
-  teaspoon dried lavender
-  *the potential list goes on*


Notes:
------

-  This is a perfect temp that allows you to cook with `Glazed
   Carrots <#glazed-carrots>`__.

-  If in a hurry you can cook this at 195°F (90.5°C) for 45 minutes.

-  Instead of putting in mason jars, put mixture into a ziplock bag and
   cook in 183°F water bath for 60 minutes agitating the bag halfway
   through. Once cooked cut corner of bag a pour into four 4 oz ramekins
   and place in refrigerator.
