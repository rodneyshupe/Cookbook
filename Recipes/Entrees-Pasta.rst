Macaroni and Cheese
===================

Ingredients
-----------

-  1 1/2 cups water
-  1 cup milk
-  8 ounces (225g) elbow macaroni
-  4 ounces (113g) velveeta, shredded *(to shred put in freezer for 30 min)*
-  1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
-  Small pinch cayenne pepper

-  1/3 cup panko bread crumbs
-  1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

   velveeta, mustard, and cayenne and cook, stirring constantly, until
   cheese is completely melted, about 1 minute. Off heat, stir in
   cheddar until evenly distributed but not melted. Cover saucepan and
   let stand for 5 minutes.

   pepper in 8-inch nonstick skillet until panko is evenly moistened.

   to 4 minutes. Off heat, sprinkle Parmesan over panko mixture and stir
   to combine. Transfer panko mixture to small bowl.
3. Stir macaroni until sauce is smooth (sauce may look loose but will
   thicken as it cools). Season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer
   to warm serving dish and sprinkle panko mixture over top. Serve
   immediately.

- Juice of 1⁄2 lemon
- 200 millilitres of double cream
- Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions
----------

1. Remove the steaks from the fridge 30 minutes before cooking to allow

   and add the oil. Then stir in the onion and garlic, and cook for two
   minutes.
3. Add the mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and continue to cook for

   stir in the pasta and cook for 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain,
   reserving a couple of tablespoons of the cooking water.
6. Leave the steaks to rest for about two minutes before serving to allow
   the juices that have been drawn to the surface to relax back into the
   meat.
7. Return the cooked pasta back to the large saucepan over low heat with
   the reserved pasta cooking water and the creamy mushroom sauce. Toss
   together and serve in warmed dishes.
8. Thinly slice the steaks and serve on top of the creamy mushroom
   linguine, scattered with some chopped rosemary and a twist of black
   pepper.

Variations
----------

* Prawns: Substitute 1lb prawns (peeled and deveined) for the steak, add
  them to mushroom mixture with cream to cook.
* Ham/Capicola: Replace mushrooms with 1/2lb ham or capicola, cubed into
  1/2 pieces. Remove steak, but add 1/2 cup peas (thawed from frozen) to
  sauce right before adding pasta.

Tagliatelle with Bolognese Sauce
================================

+-----------------------+---------------------------+-------------------+
| Prep Time: 15 minutes | Cooking Time: 1 1/4 hours | Yield: 4 servings |
+-----------------------+---------------------------+-------------------+

Source: `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/9383-weeknight-tagliatelle-with-bolognese-sauce?extcode=MKSCZ00L0&ref=new_search_experience_2>`__

Ingredients
-----------
- 1 pound (450g) 93 percent lean ground beef
- 2 tablespoons water
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- Salt and pepper
- 4 cups beef broth
- 6 ounces (170g) pancetta, chopped coarse
- 1 onion, chopped coarse
- 1 large carrot, peeled and chopped coarse
- 1 celery rib, chopped coarse
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 cup dry red wine
- 1 ounce (28g) Parmesan cheese, grated (1/2 cup), plus extra for serving
- 1 pound (450g) tagliatelle (can substitute papardelle or fettuccine)

Directions
----------
1. Toss beef with water, baking soda, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in bowl until
   thoroughly combined. Set aside.
2. While beef sits, bring broth to boil over high heat in large pot (this pot
   will be used to cook pasta in step 6) and cook until reduced to 2 cups,
   about 15 minutes; set aside.
3. Pulse pancetta in food processor until finely chopped, 15 to 20 pulses.
   Add onion, carrot, and celery and pulse until vegetables are finely chopped
   and mixture has paste-like consistency, 12 to 15 pulses, scraping down
   sides of bowl as needed.
4. Heat butter and oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until
   shimmering. When foaming subsides, add pancetta-vegetable mixture and
   1/4 teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has
   evaporated, about 8 minutes. Spread mixture in even layer in bottom of pot
   and continue to cook, stirring every couple of minutes, until very dark
   browned bits form on bottom of pot, 7 to 12 minutes longer. Stir in tomato
   paste and cook until paste is rust-colored and bottom of pot is dark brown,
   1 to 2 minutes.
5. Reduce heat to medium, add beef, and cook, using wooden spoon to break meat
   into pieces no larger than 1/4 inch, until beef has just lost its raw pink
   color, 4 to 7 minutes. Stir in wine, scraping up any browned bits, and
   bring to simmer. Cook until wine has evaporated and sauce has thickened,
   about 5 minutes. Stir in broth and Parmesan. Return sauce to simmer; cover,
   reduce heat to low, and simmer for 30 minutes (sauce will look thin).
   Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper to taste.
6. Rinse pot that held broth. While sauce simmers, bring 4 quarts water to
   boil in now-empty pot. Add pasta and 1 tablespoon salt and cook, stirring
   occasionally, until al dente. Reserve 1/4 cup cooking water, then drain
   pasta. Add pasta to pot with sauce and toss to combine. Adjust sauce
   consistency with reserved cooking water as needed. Transfer to platter or
   individual bowls and serve, passing extra Parmesan separately.
