| Total: 25 minutes | Yield: Serves 6 (Makes about 1 1/2 cups) |
+-------------------+------------------------------------------+

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 2 Dried Kashmiri red chillies
- 2 Dried Bedgi red chillies
- 1/2 lb tomatillos, washed
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 tablespoon pepitas or pumpkin seeds
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 2 tablespoons Vinegar
- Salt

Directions
----------

1. Take a wide frying pan or a cast iron skillet and heat a tablespoon
   of vegetable oil. Add the dried chillies and allow it to get toasty
   and red. The chillies will expand and get aromatic. Once they are,
   bash the garlic and add these into the frying pan/skillet along with
   the cumin seeds, pumpkin seeds and finally the tomatillos. Cook the
   tomatillos until they are squishy soft and start to fall apart when
   you stir them around. At this stage, tip the contents of the frying
   pan into a blender and whizz with 2 tbsp vinegar and salt. Taste and
   adjust the salt as per your liking.

Notes
-----

To make this salsa spicier, reserve and add the jalape√±o seeds to the
blender before processing.
