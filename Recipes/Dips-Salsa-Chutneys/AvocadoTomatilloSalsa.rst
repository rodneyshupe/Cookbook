This spectacularly simple green sauce may be the perfect summer condiment.
It requires no cooking, only takes 10 to 15 minutes to make, looks
gorgeous, and tastes amazing with anything grilled and most things that
aren't. Spoon over grilled pork tacos, grilled meats, or serve with chips.

Ingredients
-----------

- 6 ounces fresh tomatillos - husked, rinsed, and halved
- 1-2 serrano chile, thinly sliced (can substitute jalapenos)
- 1 large ripe avocado - halved, seeded, and flesh scooped out of peel
- 4 cloves garlic
- 1/4 cup packed cilantro leaves
- 1 lime, juiced
- salt to taste

Directions
----------

1. Place tomatillos into a food processor. Add serrano pepper, avocado,
   cilantro, and lime juice. Season with salt to taste. Process until
   smooth; adjust seasoning. Transfer to a serving bowl.
