I got this recipe from my friend Scott. According to him: *This recipe
is the best guacamole ever.*

Ingredients
------------

-  3 medium avocados, ripe
-  2 tablespoons minced onion
-  1 medium clove garlic, minced
-  1 small jalapeno chili, minced (1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons)
-  1/4 cup minced fresh cilantro leaves
-  1/4 teaspoon table salt
-  1/2 - 3/4 teaspoon ground cumin
-  2 tablespoons lime juice

Directions
----------

1. Halve one avocado, remove pit, and scoop flesh into medium bowl. Mash
   flesh lightly with onion, garlic, jalapeno, cilantro, salt, and cumin
   (if using) with tines of a fork until just combined. *To minimize the
   risk of discoloration, prepare the minced ingredients first so they
   are ready to mix with the avocados as soon as they are cut.*
2. Halve and pit remaining two avocados, and prepare. Gently scoop out
   avocado into bowl with mashed avocado mixture.
3. Sprinkle lime juice over diced avocado and mix entire contents of
   bowl lightly with fork until combined but still chunky. Adjust
   seasoning with salt, if necessary, and serve. (Can be covered with
   plastic wrap, pressed directly onto surface of mixture, and
   refrigerated up to one day. Return guacamole to room temperature,
   removing plastic wrap at the last moment, before serving).
