For a twist on a traditional salsa made with fresh tomatoes, we use
jarred sun-dried tomatoes. (We find that the oil-packed type have the
best flavor.) Fresh basil and parsley add herbal depth, while balsamic
vinegar and extra-virgin olive oil turn it into a sauce.

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 tablespoons oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, rinsed and chopped fine
-  2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
-  2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat leaf parsley
-  2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
-  1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
-  1/2 small shallot, minced
-  Salt and pepper

Directions
----------

1. Combine all ingredients in bowl and season with salt and pepper to
   taste.
