Guacamole
=========

+----------------------+--------------------------+---------------+
| Prep Time: 5 minutes | Cooking Time: 10 minutes | Yield: 2 cups |
+----------------------+--------------------------+---------------+

I got this recipe from my friend Scott. According to him:
    This recipe is the best guacamole ever.

Ingredients
------------

-  3 medium avocados, ripe
-  2 tablespoons minced onion
-  1 medium clove garlic, minced
-  1 small jalapeno chili, minced (1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons)
-  1/4 cup minced fresh cilantro leaves
-  1/4 teaspoon table salt
-  1/2 - 3/4 teaspoon ground cumin
-  2 tablespoons lime juice

Directions
----------

1. Halve one avocado, remove pit, and scoop flesh into medium bowl. Mash
   flesh lightly with onion, garlic, jalapeno, cilantro, salt, and cumin
   (if using) with tines of a fork until just combined. *To minimize the
   risk of discoloration, prepare the minced ingredients first so they
   are ready to mix with the avocados as soon as they are cut.*
2. Halve and pit remaining two avocados, and prepare. Gently scoop out
   avocado into bowl with mashed avocado mixture.
3. Sprinkle lime juice over diced avocado and mix entire contents of
   bowl lightly with fork until combined but still chunky. Adjust
   seasoning with salt, if necessary, and serve. (Can be covered with
   plastic wrap, pressed directly onto surface of mixture, and
   refrigerated up to one day. Return guacamole to room temperature,
   removing plastic wrap at the last moment, before serving).

Canned Salsa
============

+------------------+--------------------------+----------------+
| Prep: 45 minutes | Total: 6 hours 5 minutes | Yield: 8 pints |
+------------------+--------------------------+----------------+

Source: `AllRecipes (Tami) <https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/175547/rockin-salsa/>`__

This is a recipe I came up with by combining two of my favourite recipes
into one awesome recipe. You can make this salsa as hot as you want by
adding more peppers.

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 red onion, chopped
- 1 white onion, chopped
- 1 yellow onion, chopped
- 6 pounds fresh tomatoes, peeled and chopped
- 2 banana peppers, chopped
- 3 green bell peppers, chopped
- 3 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
- 1/2 cup white vinegar
- 2 tablespoons garlic powder
- 1 1/2 tablespoons salt
- 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 1/4 cup white sugar
- 8 pint canning jars with lids and rings

Directions
----------

1. Combine red onion, white onion, yellow onion, tomatoes, banana peppers,
   green peppers, tomato paste, white vinegar, garlic powder, salt, cayenne
   pepper, cumin, brown sugar, and white sugar in a large pot. Simmer until
   thick, about 3 hours.
2. Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes.
   Pack the salsa into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within
   1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of
   the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the
   rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue.
   Top with lids, and screw on rings.
3. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with
   water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars
   into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2 inch space between the jars. Pour
   in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1
   inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a full boil, cover
   the pot, and process for 10 to 15 minutes.
4. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood
   surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of
   each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not
   move up or down at all). Refrigerate after opening.

Chilli Tomatillo Salsa
======================

+-------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Total: 25 minutes | Yield: Serves 6 (Makes about 1 1/2 cups) |
+-------------------+------------------------------------------+

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 2 Dried Kashmiri red chillies
- 2 Dried Bedgi red chillies
- 1/2 lb tomatillos, washed
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 tablespoon pepitas or pumpkin seeds
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 2 tablespoons Vinegar
- Salt

Directions
----------

1. Take a wide frying pan or a cast iron skillet and heat a tablespoon
   of vegetable oil. Add the dried chillies and allow it to get toasty
   and red. The chillies will expand and get aromatic. Once they are,
   bash the garlic and add these into the frying pan/skillet along with
   the cumin seeds, pumpkin seeds and finally the tomatillos. Cook the
   tomatillos until they are squishy soft and start to fall apart when
   you stir them around. At this stage, tip the contents of the frying
   pan into a blender and whizz with 2 tbsp vinegar and salt. Taste and
   adjust the salt as per your liking.

Notes
-----

To make this salsa spicier, reserve and add the jalapeño seeds to the

Source: `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/8060-sun-dried-tomato-and-basil-salsa-for-two>`__

For a twist on a traditional salsa made with fresh tomatoes, we use
jarred sun-dried tomatoes. (We find that the oil-packed type have the
best flavor.) Fresh basil and parsley add herbal depth, while balsamic
vinegar and extra-virgin olive oil turn it into a sauce.

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 tablespoons oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, rinsed and chopped fine
-  2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
-  2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat leaf parsley
-  2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
-  1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
-  1/2 small shallot, minced
-  Salt and pepper

Directions
----------

1. Combine all ingredients in bowl and season with salt and pepper to
   taste.
