Ingredients
-----------

-  2 ripe mangos
-  1/4 - 1/2 red onion
-  1-2 jalapeno or serrano peppers
-  fresh lemon or lime juice
-  salt
-  fresh cilantro to taste
-  cayenne pepper to taste (optional but awesome)

Directions
----------

1. Fine dice a whole jalapeno and a little less than 1/2 an onion.
2. For the mangos, cut off the mango cheeks and cut the mango while it’s
   still in the skin. Get as close to the skin as possible with the tip
   of the knife! Then use a spoon to scoop out the cut mango. If the
   mango is coming out still attached at the base, don’t go as deep with
   the spoon.
3. Put all the diced ingredients into a bowl.
4. Add a handful of chopped cilantro leaves (no stems!) and a good pinch
   of salt. Then squeeze the juice of half a lemon on top.
5. Mix this all together.
