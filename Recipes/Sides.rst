Roasted Potatoes
================


Ingredients
-----------

-  3lb. White potatoes, peeled
-  Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
-  Olive oil
-  1 bulb of garlic, broken into cloves
-  Red wine vinegar

Flavor Combo1
-------------

-  A good couple of lugs of olive oil
-  A bunch of fresh rosemary, leaves picked

Flavor Combo 2
--------------

-  50g butter, cut into little cubes
-  A bunch of fresh sage, roughly torn
-  1 clementine

Flavor Combo 3
--------------

-  2 tablespoons goose fat
-  A bunch of fresh thyme, leaves picked
-  A couple of fresh bay leaves


Directions
----------

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F. Peel your potatoes with a knife or speed
   peeler and cut any larger ones so they’re all an even-size - twice
   the size of a squash ball is about right. Wash your potatoes in cold
   water to get rid of any extra starch then tip into a large pot, cover
   with cold water and season well. Bring to the boil and cook for about
   6 to 7 minutes, so that they’re parboiled, then drain in a colander
   and leave to steam dry for 3 minutes. Give the colander a bit of a
   shake to help chuff up the potatoes - this will help to make them
   super crisp later on.
2. At this point, you need to decide which flavour combo to go with. Tip
   your potatoes into a tray or pan in one layer, and add your fat -
   olive oil, butter or goose fat - then season really well with salt
   and pepper. At this stage, I’m not going to add any more flavour.
   Toss your potatoes in the fat, or use a spoon or fish slice to mix it
   all up. You could get the potatoes up to this stage the day before,
   simply cover them with cling film or tin foil and pop in the bottom
   of your fridge or in a cool place until you need them. Put your
   potatoes in the hot oven to cook for 30 minutes until lightly golden
   and three quarters cooked.
3. Now’s the time for my new trick. Gently squash each potato with a
   potato masher to increase the surface area - the more of your potato
   that’s in contact with the pan, the crispier it will be. Whichever
   fat you’re using, you now want to prepare the rest of the
   flavourings. Add a good lug of olive oil to a small bowl and add the
   herbs, garlic and a splash of red wine vinegar, then scrunch and mix
   it up a bit. If you’re using butter, peel in a good few strips of
   clementine zest with a speed peeler - you won’t eat these but they’ll
   add amazing flavour. Add the flavour to your potatoes and give the
   pan a good shake, then pop back in the hot oven for 40 to 45 minutes
   until perfect for your liking. You’re looking for gnarly, crispy,
   bubbly and delicious.
4. Transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain off some of the
   excess fat, then tuck in! I’d be happy with any of these flavour
   combos, but this year I’ll be going for butter, but maybe with the
   rosemary and garlic. So you really can mix it up however you like.

Scalloped Potatoes
==================

Source: `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/36-scalloped-potatoes>`__

Serves: 4 to 6


Ingredients
-----------

-  2 tablespoons unsalted butter
-  1 medium onion, minced (about 1 cup)
-  2 medium cloves garlic, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)
-  1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme leaves
-  1 1/4 teaspoons table salt
-  1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
-  2 1/2 pounds russet potatoes (about 5 medium), peeled and sliced 1/8-inch thick (see photos below)
-  1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
-  1 cup heavy cream
-  2 bay leaves
-  4 ounces grated cheddar cheese, shredded (1 cup)


Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position; heat oven to 425°F.
2. Melt butter in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until foaming
   subsides. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and
   lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Add garlic, thyme, salt, and
   pepper; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add potatoes, chicken
   broth, cream, and bay leaves and bring to simmer. Cover, reduce heat
   to medium-low, and simmer until potatoes are almost tender (paring
   knife can be slipped into and out of potato slice with some
   resistance), about 10 minutes. Discard bay leaves.
3. Transfer mixture to 8-inch-square baking dish (or other 1 1/2-quart
   gratin dish) and press to an even layer; sprinkle evenly with cheese.
   Bake until cream is bubbling around edges and top is golden brown,
   about 15 minutes. Cool 10 minutes before serving.


Make Ahead
----------

Once the scalloped potatoes have been transferred to the baking dish and
pressed into an even layer in step 3, they can be wrapped in plastic
wrap and refrigerated for up to 24 hours. When ready to bake, add the
cheese, cover with foil, and bake in a 400°F oven until the mixture is
hot and bubbling, about 45 minutes. Remove the foil and cook until the
cheddar begins to brown, about 30 minutes longer. Let cool for 10
minutes before serving.

Classic Risotto
===============

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
-  1 onion, chopped
-  4 clove garlic, minced
-  2 cup Arborio rice
-  1 cup Italian white wine
-  8 cup real chicken broth, simmering hot
-  1 cup good quality Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, shredded
-  1 Tbsp (or so) of butter
-  a few sprigs of fresh thyme or any fresh herb, minced

Directions
----------

1. Lightly simmer the chicken broth in one pot as you make the risotto
   in another pot.
2. Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, then add in the
   onions and garlic. Saute until golden and fragrant, a few minutes.
   Add the rice and continue to cook and stir over medium high heat,
   coating the grains evenly with the oil, until the rice grains give
   off a toasty aroma and transform from pure white to almost entirely
   opaque.
3. Add in the white wine and stir frequently as the rice absorbs the
   liquid. Reduce your heat to low. Start adding the hot chicken stock
   in several additions, stirring frequently after each one and allowing
   the rice to absorb the broth. Continue to cook and stir the risotto
   until the rice is just tender or al dente (soft with an ever so
   slight bite to the center) and creamy. The Arborio rice will
   gradually release its starch and thicken the extra liquid into
   creaminess. Creamy is important if you’re going for authenticity!
   This will take about 20 minutes from when you start adding the
   liquid.
4. To finish stir in the Parmesan, butter and minced fresh herbs. Spoon
   into dishes piping hot and share.

Variations
----------

1. Cook 1 diced chorizo before step 2 in the pan. Remove choizo and set
   aside. In step 2 use rendered fat in place of some of the olive oil.
   Re-add chorico when adding last batch of liquid in step 3. Add 1 cup
   of cooked peas in step 4 instead of herbs.
2. Add chopped meat from 1 lobster tail to risotto mixture in step 3
   half way through adding the liquids.

- 6 sprigs fresh thyme
- 4 sprigs fresh parsley leaves
- 1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms, rinsed in mesh strainer under running water
- 3 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 1/4 pounds cremini mushrooms, wiped clean with a paper towel, stems discarded, and caps cut into fourths if small or sixths if medium or large
- 2 medium onions, chopped fine (2 cups)
- Salt
- 3 medium cloves garlic, pressed through garlic press or minced (about 1 tablespoon)
- 1 pound Arborio rice (2 1/8 cups)
- 1 cup dry white wine or dry vermouth
- 2 ounces Parmesan cheese, finely grated (about 1 cup)
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves
- Ground black pepper

Directions
----------
1. Tie together bay leaves, thyme sprigs, and parsley sprigs with kitchen
   twine. Bring bundled herbs, porcini mushrooms, chicken broth, soy sauce,
   and 3 1/2 cups water to boil in medium saucepan over medium-high heat;
   reduce to medium-low and simmer until dried mushrooms are softened and
   fully hydrated, about 15 minutes. Remove and discard herb bundle and
   strain broth through fine-mesh strainer set over medium bowl (you should
   have about 6 1/2 cups strained liquid); return liquid to saucepan and
   keep warm over low heat. Finely mince porcini and set aside.
2. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Heat
   2 tablespoons butter in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.
   When foaming subsides, add cremini mushrooms, 1 cup onions, and
   1/2 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring occasionally, until moisture released
   by mushrooms evaporates and mushrooms are well browned, about 7 minutes.
   Stir in garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute, then transfer mushrooms
   to oven-safe bowl and keep warm in oven. Off heat, add 1/4 cup water to
   now-empty skillet and scrape with wooden spoon to loosen any browned
   bits; pour liquid from skillet into saucepan with broth.
3. Heat 3 tablespoons butter in large saucepan over medium heat. When
   foaming subsides, add remaining 1 cup onions and 1/4 teaspoon salt; cook,
   stirring occasionally, until onions are softened and translucent, about
   9 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring frequently, until grains’ edges
   are transparent, about 4 minutes. Add wine and cook, stirring frequently,
   until rice absorbs wine. Add minced porcini and 3 1/2 cups broth and cook,
   stirring every 2 to 3 minutes, until liquid is absorbed, 9 to 11 minutes.
   Stir in additional 1/2 cup broth every 2 to 3 minutes until rice is
   cooked through but grains are still somewhat firm at center,
   10 to 12 minutes (rice may not require all of broth). Stir in remaining
   1 tablespoon butter, then stir in mushrooms (and any accumulated juices),
   Parmesan, and chopped parsley. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper;
   serve immediately in warmed bowls.

Oven-Fried Onion Rings
======================

+-----------------------+------------------+---------------+
| Prep Time: 10 minutes | Cook: 25 minutes | Servings: 4-6 |
+-----------------------+------------------+---------------+

Source: `Cooks Country <https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/2938-oven-fried-onion-rings>`__


Ingredients
-----------

-  1/2 cup all-purpose flour
-  1 large egg, at room temperature
-  1/2 cup buttermilk, at room temperature  (substitute 3/4 teaspoons of cream of tartar and 1/2 cup milk)
-  1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
-  Salt and pepper
-  30 saltines
-  4 cups kettle-cooked potato chips
-  2 large yellow onions cut into 24 large rings (see note)
-  6 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven racks to lower-middle and upper-middle positions and heat
   oven to 450°F. Place 1/4 cup flour in shallow baking dish. Beat egg
   and buttermilk together in medium bowl. Whisk remaining 1/4 cup
   flour, cayenne, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper into
   buttermilk mixture. Pulse saltines and chips together in food
   processor until finely ground and place in separate shallow baking
   dish.
2. Pull apart the rings in each round, discarding any that are less than

   in oven and heat until just smoking, about 8 minutes. Carefully tilt
   heated sheets to coat evenly with oil, then arrange onion rings on
   sheets. Bake, flipping onion rings over and switching and rotating
   position of baking sheets halfway through baking, until golden brown
   on both sides, about 15 minutes. Transfer onion rings to plates lined
   with paper towels to drain briefly. Serve immediately.


Make Ahead
----------

Oven-Fried Onion Rings can be breaded in advance and refrigerated for up
to an hour. Let them sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before
baking; if baked straight from the fridge, the onions will not soften
properly and will remain crunchy.

Potato Latkes
=============

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 pounds russet potatoes, unpeeled, scrubbed, and shredded
-  1/2 cup grated onion
-  Salt and pepper
-  2 large eggs, lightly beaten
-  2 teaspoons minced fresh parsley
-  Vegetable oil

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position, place rimmed baking sheet on
   rack, and heat oven to 200°F. Toss potatoes, onion, and 1
   teaspoon salt in bowl. Place half of potato mixture in center of dish
   towel. Gather ends together and twist tightly to drain as much liquid
   as possible, reserving liquid in liquid measuring cup. Transfer
   drained potato mixture to second bowl and repeat process with
   remaining potato mixture. Set potato liquid aside and let stand so
   starch settles to bottom, at least 5 minutes.
2. Cover potato mixture and microwave until just warmed through but not
   hot, 1 to 2 minutes, stirring mixture with fork every 30 seconds.
   Spread potato mixture evenly over second rimmed baking sheet and let
   cool for 10 minutes. Don’t wash out bowl.
3. Pour off water from reserved potato liquid, leaving potato starch in
   measuring cup. Add eggs and stir until smooth. Return cooled potato
   mixture to bowl. Add parsley, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and potato starch
   mixture and toss until evenly combined.
4. Set wire rack in clean rimmed baking sheet and line with triple layer
   of paper towels. Heat 1/4-inch depth of oil in 12-inch skillet over
   medium-high heat until shimmering but not smoking (350°F).
   Place 1/4-cup mound of potato mixture in oil and press with nonstick
   spatula into 1/3-inch-thick disk. Repeat until 5 latkes are in pan.
   Cook, adjusting heat so fat bubbles around latke edges, until golden
   brown on bottom, about 3 minutes. Turn and continue cooking until
   golden brown on second side, about 3 minutes longer. Drain on paper
   towels and transfer to baking sheet in oven. Repeat with remaining
   potato mixture, adding oil to maintain 1/4-inch depth and returning
   oil to 350°F between batches. Season with salt and pepper to
   taste, and serve immediately.

Make Ahead
----------

Cooled latkes can be covered loosely with plastic wrap and held at room
temperature for up to 4 hours. Alternatively, they can be frozen on
baking sheet until firm, transferred to zipper-lock bag, and frozen for
up to 1 month. Reheat latkes in 375-degree oven until crisp and hot, 3
minutes per side for room-temperature latkes and 6 minutes per side for
frozen latkes.

Persian-Style Rice with Golden Crust - Chelow
=============================================

Source: `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/8718-persian-style-rice-with-golden-crust-chelow>`__

*Chelow* is a classic Iranian dish that marries an unusually light and
fluffy rice pilaf with a golden-brown, crispy crust (which is known as
tahdig). It is, in essence, two dishes in one.

Ingredients
-----------
-  2 cups basmati rice
-  Salt
-  1 tablespoon plus 1/4 cup vegetable oil
-  1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt
-  1 1/2 teaspoons cumin seeds
-  2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 8 cubes
-  1/4 cup minced fresh flat leaf parsley


Directions
----------
1. Place rice in fine-mesh strainer and rinse under cold running water
   until water runs clear. Place rinsed rice and 1 tablespoon salt in
   medium bowl and cover with 4 cups hot tap water. Stir gently to
   dissolve salt; let stand for 15 minutes. Drain rice in fine-mesh
   strainer.
2. Meanwhile, bring 8 cups water to boil in Dutch oven over high heat.
   Add rice and 2 tablespoons salt. Boil briskly, stirring frequently,
   until rice is mostly tender with slight bite in center and grains are
   floating toward top of pot, 3 to 5 minutes (begin timing from when
   rice is added to pot).
3. Drain rice in large fine-mesh strainer and rinse with cold water to
   stop cooking, about 30 seconds. Rinse and dry pot well to remove any
   residual starch. Brush bottom and 1 inch up sides of pot with 1
   tablespoon oil.
4. Whisk remaining 1/4 cup oil, yogurt, 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, and 1/4
   teaspoon salt together in medium bowl. Add 2 cups parcooked rice and
   stir until combined. Spread yogurt-rice mixture evenly over bottom of
   prepared pot, packing it down well.
5. Stir remaining 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds into remaining rice. Mound
   rice in center of pot on top of yogurt-rice base (it should look like
   small hill). Poke 8 equally spaced holes through rice mound but not
   into yogurt-rice base. Place 1 butter cube in each hole. Drizzle 1/3
   cup water over rice mound.
6. Wrap pot lid with clean dish towel and cover pot tightly, making sure
   towel is secure on top of lid and away from heat. Cook over
   medium-high heat until rice on bottom is crackling and steam is
   coming from sides of pot, about 10 minutes, rotating pot halfway
   through for even cooking.
7. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook until rice is tender
   and fluffy and crust is golden brown around edges, 30 to 35 minutes
   longer. Remove covered pot from heat and place on damp dish towel set
   in rimmed baking sheet; let stand for 5 minutes.
8. Stir 2 tablespoons parsley into rice, making sure not to disturb
   crust on bottom of pot, and season with salt to taste. Gently spoon
   rice onto serving platter.
9. Using thin metal spatula, loosen edges of crust from pot, then break
   crust into large pieces. Transfer pieces to serving platter,
   arranging evenly around rice. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons
   parsley and serve.

Cuban Black Beans
=================

Ingredients
-----------

-  1 pound dried black beans picked over and rinsed
-  1 green bell pepper quartered lengthwise
-  2 Bay Leaves
-  1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil
-  1 red, 1 green and 1 yellow pepper minced
-  1 large white onion minced
-  1 tablespoon ground cumin
-  1 tablespoon oregano
-  1/2 cup minced garlic
-  1/4 cup tomato paste
-  Salt


Directions
----------

1. Put the black beans, quartered green pepper and bay leaves in a large
   saucepan add 8 cups of water. Bring to a boil over moderately high
   heat. Reduce the heat to low, partially cover the saucepan and cook,
   stirring occasionally, until the beans are tender, about 2 1/2 hours.
   Remove and discard the green pieces and bay leaves.
2. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet.
   Add the minced bell peppers and onion and cook over moderate heat
   until softened. Stir in the cumin and oregano. In a small saucepan,
   cook the garlic in the remaining 1/2 cup of olive oil over moderately
   low heat until golden brown.
3. When the beans are tender, add the sauteed pepper mixture, the garlic
   in its oil and the tomato paste. Season with salt and simmer gently
   for 5 minutes to blend the flavours. Cover and refrigerate overnight
   or for up to 3 days. Reheat gently before serving.

Note
----

In a pinch you can substitute 3 19oz cans of black beans and don’t add
the water. Still simmer with the green onion to infuse the flavour.

Barbecued Baked Beans
=====================

Ingredients
-----------

-  4 ounces bacon (4 slices), chopped fine
-  1 onion, minced
-  4 cloves garlic, minced
-  1 pound dried small white beans (2 cups), rinsed and picked over
-  8 cups water
-  1 cup strong coffee (black)
-  1/2 cup barbecue sauce, plus extra for seasoning
-  1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar
-  4 1/2 teaspoons brown mustard (prepared)
-  1 tablespoon mild molasses
-  Tabasco sauce (or something similar)


Directions
----------

1. Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and heat the oven to
   300°F. Cook the bacon in a large Dutch oven over medium heat until
   beginning to crisp, about 5 minutes. Stir in the onion and cook until
   the onion is softened, about 5 minutes.
2. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Stir in
   the beans, water, coffee, barbecue sauce, brown sugar, mustard,
   molasses, 1/2 teaspoon Tabasco, and 1 1/4 teaspoons salt. Bring to a
   boil, scraping up any browned bits. Cover and transfer to the oven.
   Bake, stirring every hour, until the beans are tender, about 4 hours.
3. Remove the lid and continue to bake, uncovered, until the liquid has
   thickened to a syrupy consistency, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Season the beans
   with additional barbecue sauce, Tabasco, and salt and pepper to
   taste.


Make-a-head
-----------

After cooking, the beans can be cooled to room temperature and
refrigerated, wrapping tightly in plastic wrap, for up to 4 days. Reheat
over medium-low heat before serving.

Cabbage Kimchi
==============

Ingredients
-----------

-  1 medium head (2 pounds) napa cabbage
-  1/4 cup kosher salt (see Recipe Notes)
-  Water (see Recipe Notes)
-  1 tablespoon grated garlic (5 to 6 cloves)
-  1 teaspoon grated ginger
-  1 teaspoon sugar
-  2 to 3 tablepoons seafood flavor or water (optional, see Recipe Notes)
-  1 to 5 tablespoons Korean red pepper flakes (gochugaru)
-  8 ounces Korean radish or daikon, peeled and cut into matchsticks
-  4 scallions, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces

Directions
----------

1. Salt the cabbage: Place the cabbage and salt in a large bowl. Using
   your hands (gloves optional), massage the salt into the cabbage until
   it starts to soften a bit, then add water to cover the cabbage. Put a
   plate on top and weigh it down with something heavy, like a jar or
   can of beans. Let stand for 1 to 2 hours.
2. Rinse and drain the cabbage: Rinse the cabbage under cold water 3
   times and drain in a colander for 15 to 20 minutes. Rinse and dry the
   bowl you used for salting, and set it aside to use in step 5.
3. Make the paste: Meanwhile, combine the garlic, ginger, sugar, and
   seafood flavor (or 3 tablespoons water) in a small bowl and mix to
   form a smooth paste. Mix in the gochugaru, using 1 tablespoon for
   mild and up to 5 tablespoons for spicy (I like about 3 1/2
   tablespoons).
4. Combine the vegetables and paste: Gently squeeze any remaining water
   from the cabbage and return it to the bowl along with the radish,
   scallions, and seasoning paste.
5. Mix thoroughly: Using your hands, gently work the paste into the
   vegetables until they are thoroughly coated. The gloves are optional
   here but highly recommended to protect your hands from stings,
   stains, and smells!
6. Pack the kimchi into the jar: Pack the kimchi into the jar, pressing
   down on it until the brine rises to cover the vegetables. Leave at
   least 1 inch of headspace. Seal the jar with the lid.
7. Let it ferment: Let the jar stand at room temperature for 1 to 5
   days. You may see bubbles inside the jar and brine may seep out of
   the lid; place a bowl or plate under the jar to help catch any
   overflow.
8. Check it daily and refrigerate when ready: Check the kimchi once a
   day, pressing down on the vegetables with a clean finger or spoon to
   keep them submerged under the brine. (This also releases gases
   produced during fermentation.) Taste a little at this point, too!
   When the kimchi tastes ripe enough for your liking, transfer the jar
   to the refrigerator. You may eat it right away, but it’s best after
   another week or two.

Garlic Bread
============

Ingredients
-----------
- 9 - 10 medium cloves garlic (about the size of a plump cashew nut), skins left on
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/2 teaspoon table salt
- 1 loaf Italian bread (high-quality); about 1 pound, football-shaped), halved lengthwise

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 500°F. Meanwhile,
   toast garlic cloves in small skillet over medium heat, shaking pan
   occasionally, until fragrant and color of cloves deepens slightly, about

   have about 3 tablespoons). Using dinner fork, mash garlic, butter, cheese,

Garlic bread is best served piping hot, so time it to arrive at the table last,
once all the other dishes are finished and ready to serve.
