Barbecue Ribs
=============

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 racks pork ribs (I prefer to use side ribs)
-  1 cup `Basic Barbecue Rub <#basic-barbecue-rub>`__
-  1 cup `Kansas City Style Sweet and Smoky Barbecue Sauce <#kansas-city-style-sweet-and-smoky-barbecue-sauce>`__
-  2 cups wood chips, preferably apple wood, soaked in 2 cups apple
   cider for 1 hour then drained

Directions
----------

1. Remove the papery skin on the back of each rack of ribs by pulling it
   off in a sheet with your fingers or a pair of pliers.
2. Sprinkle the ribs on both sides with two thirds of the rub patting it
   in with your fingers. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 -
   4 hours.
3. Set up the grill for indirect grilling. If using a charcoal grill,
   toss the wood chips on the coals. If using a gas grill, place the
   chips in a smoker box. Don’t grill until you see smoke.
4. Place the ribs in the center of the grill away from the fire.
   Indirect Grill for about 1 hour. The temperature should be around
   325°F.
5. Brush ribs with half of the cup of Barbecue sauce. (Set aside the
   other half for serving on the side at the table.)
6. Increase the heat and continue indirect grilling until the ribs are
   done 15-30 minutes. When done the meat will be very tender and will
   have pulled back from the ends of the bones.
7. Transfer the ribs to a platter. Sprinkle with the remaining rub and
   serve with the other half cup of barbecue sauce.

Oven Baked Baby Back Ribs
=========================

Source: `Alton Brown <https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/who-loves-ya-baby-back-recipe-1937448>`__

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 whole slabs pork baby back ribs
- 1/2 recipe `Alton Brown's Dry Rub <#alton-brown-dry-rub>`__
- 1 cup white wine
- 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped

Directions
-----------
1. Preheat oven to 250 degrees.
2. Place each slab of baby back ribs on a piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil,
   shiny side down. Sprinkle each side generously with the dry rub. Pat the
   dry rub into the meat. Refrigerate the ribs for a minimum of 1 hour but
   preferably overnight.
3. In a microwavable container, combine wine, vinegar, worcestershire, honey
   and garlic for the braising liquid. Microwave on high for 1 minute.
4. Place the ribs on a baking sheet. Open one end of the foil on each slab
   and pour half of the braising liquid into each foil packet. Tilt the
   baking sheet in order to equally distribute the braising liquid. Braise
   the ribs in the oven for 2 1/2 hours.
5. Transfer the braising liquid into a medium saucepot. Bring the liquid to
   a simmer and reduce by half or until of a thick syrup consistency. Brush
   the glaze onto the ribs. Place under the broiler just until the glaze
   caramelizes lightly. Slice each slab into 2 rib bone portions. Place the
   remaining hot glaze into a bowl and toss the rib portions in the glaze.

Chinese-Style Barbecued Spareribs
=================================

+----------------+----------------+-------------------------+
| Prep Time: 10  | Cooking Time:  | Yield: 6-8 as Appetizer |
| minutes        | 2 hours        | 4-6 as main course      |
+----------------+----------------+-------------------------+

Source: `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/10314-chinese-style-barbecued-spareribs#>`__

Ingredients
-----------

-  1 (6-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and sliced thin
-  8 garlic cloves, peeled
-  1 cup honey
-  3/4 cup hoisin sauce
-  3/4 cup soy sauce
-  1/2 cup Chinese rice wine or dry sherry
-  2 teaspoons five-spice powder
-  1 teaspoon red food coloring (optional)
-  1 teaspoon ground white pepper
-  2 racks St. Louis-style spareribs, 2 1/2 to 3 pound (1.1 to 1.4 kg), cut into individual ribs
-  2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil

Directions
----------

1. Pulse ginger and garlic in food processor until finely chopped, 10 to
   12 pulses, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Transfer
   ginger-garlic mixture to Dutch oven. Add honey; hoisin; soy sauce;
   1/2 cup water; rice wine; five-spice powder; food coloring, if using;
   and pepper and whisk until combined. Add ribs and stir to coat (ribs
   will not be fully submerged). Bring to simmer over high heat, then
   reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 1 1/4 hours, stirring
   occasionally.
2. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425°F.
   Using tongs, transfer ribs to large bowl. Strain braising liquid
   through fine-mesh strainer set over large container, pressing on
   solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard solids. Let
   cooking liquid settle for 10 minutes. Using wide, shallow spoon, skim
   fat from surface and discard.
3. Return braising liquid to pot and add sesame oil. Bring to boil over
   high heat and cook until syrupy and reduced to 2 1/2 cups, 16 to 20
   minutes.
4. Set wire rack in aluminum foil–lined rimmed baking sheet and pour 1/2
   cup water into sheet. Transfer half of ribs to pot with braising
   liquid and toss to coat. Arrange ribs, bone sides up, on prepared
   rack, letting excess glaze drip off. Roast until edges of ribs start
   to caramelize, 5 to 7 minutes. Flip ribs and continue to roast until
   second side starts to caramelize, 5 to 7 minutes longer. Transfer
   ribs to serving platter; repeat process with remaining ribs. Serve.

Make Ahead
----------

At end of step 3, refrigerate ribs and glaze separately, covered, for up
to 2 days. When ready to serve, bring glaze and half of ribs to simmer
in Dutch oven over medium heat, then proceed with step 4. Repeat with
remaining ribs.

Notes
-----

It’s not necessary to remove the membrane on the bone side of the ribs.
These ribs are chewier than American-style ribs; if you prefer them more
tender, cook them for an additional 15 minutes in step 1. Adding water
to the baking sheet during roasting helps prevent smoking. Serve the
ribs alone as an appetizer or with vegetables and rice as a main course.
You can serve the first batch immediately or tent them with foil to keep
them warm.

Indoor Pulled Pork
==================

+------------------------+-----------------------+---------------------+
| Prep Time: 2 1/2 hours | Cooking Time: 5 hours | Yield: 6-8 servings |
+------------------------+-----------------------+---------------------+

Ingredients
-----------

Pork
^^^^

-  1 cup plus 2 teaspoons table salt
-  1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
-  3 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons liquid smoke
-  1 boneless pork butt, about 5 pounds (2.3kg), cut in half horizontally (see step by step below)
-  1/4 cup yellow mustard
-  2 tablespoons ground black pepper
-  2 tablespoons smoked paprika (see note)
-  1 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Sweet and Tangy Barbecue Sauce
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  1 1/2 cups ketchup
-  1/4 cup light or mild molasses
-  2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
-  1 tablespoon hot sauce
-  1/2 teaspoon table salt
-  1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions
----------

Pork
^^^^

1. For the pork: Dissolve 1 cup salt, 1/2 cup sugar, and 3 tablespoons
   liquid smoke in 4 quarts cold water in large container. Submerge pork
   in brine, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 2 hours.
2. While pork brines, combine mustard and remaining 2 teaspoons liquid
   smoke in small bowl; set aside. Combine black pepper, paprika,
   remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, remaining 2 teaspoons salt, and
   cayenne in second small bowl; set aside. Adjust oven rack to
   lower-middle position and heat oven to 325°F.
3. Remove pork from brine and dry thoroughly with paper towels. Rub
   mustard mixture over entire surface of each piece of pork. Sprinkle
   entire surface of each piece with spice mixture. Place pork on wire
   rack set inside foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Place piece of
   parchment paper over pork, then cover with sheet of aluminum foil,
   sealing edges to prevent moisture from escaping. Roast pork for 3
   hours.
4. Remove pork from oven; remove and discard foil and parchment.
   Carefully pour off liquid in bottom of baking sheet into fat
   separator and reserve for sauce. Return pork to oven and cook,
   uncovered, until well browned, tender, and internal temperature
   registers 200°F on instant-read thermometer, about 1 1/2 hours.
   Transfer pork to serving dish, tent loosely with foil, and let rest
   for 20 minutes.
5. To serve: Using 2°Forks, shred pork into bite-sized pieces. Toss with
   1 cup sauce and season with salt and pepper. Serve, passing remaining
   sauce separately.

Sweet and Tangy Sauce
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. While pork rests, pour 1/2 cup of defatted cooking liquid from fat
   separator into medium bowl; whisk in sauce ingredients.

Notes
-----

Sweet paprika may be substituted for smoked paprika. Covering the pork
with parchment and then foil prevents the acidic mustard from eating
holes in the foil. Serve the pork on hamburger rolls with pickle chips
and thinly sliced onion. As an alternative to the Sweet and Tangy
Barbecue Sauce, use 2 cups of your favorite barbecue sauce thinned with
1/2 cup of the defatted pork cooking liquid in step 5. The shredded and
sauced pork can be cooled, tightly covered, and refrigerated for up to 2
days. Reheat it gently before serving.

+--------------------+----------------------+
| Total: 3 1/2 hours | Yield: Serves 6 to 8 |
+--------------------+----------------------+

Source: `Cook's Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/6952-spicy-pork-tacos-al-pastor>`__


Ingredients
-----------

- 10 large dried guajillo chile, wiped clean
- 1 1/2 cups water
- 1 1/4 pounds plum tomato, cored and quartered
- 8 garlic clove, peeled
- 4 bay leaf
- Salt and pepper
- 3/4 teaspoon sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
- 3 pounds boneless pork butt roast
- 1 lime, cut into 8 wedges
- 1/2 pineapple, peeled, cored, and cut into 1/2-inch-thick rings
- Vegetable oil
- 18 (6-inch) corn tortilla, warmed
- 1 small onion, chopped fine
- 1/2 cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro

Directions
----------

1. Toast guajillos in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until softened
   and fragrant, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer to large plate and, when cool
   enough to handle, remove stems.
2. Bring toasted guajillos, water, tomatoes, garlic, bay leaves, 2
   teaspoons salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, sugar, cumin, and cloves to simmer
   in now-empty Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cover, reduce heat, and
   simmer, stirring occasionally, until guajillos are softened and tomatoes
   mash easily, about 20 minutes.
3. While sauce simmers, trim excess fat from exterior of pork, leaving
   1/4-inch-thick fat cap. Slice pork against grain into 1/2-inch-thick
   slabs.
4. Transfer guajillo-tomato mixture to blender and process until smooth,
   about 1 minute. Strain puree through fine-mesh strainer, pressing on
   solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Return puree to pot,
   submerge pork slices in liquid, and bring to simmer over medium heat.
   Partially cover, reduce heat, and gently simmer until pork is tender but
   still holds together, 90 to 105 minutes, flipping and rearranging pork
   halfway through cooking. (Pork can be left in sauce, cooled to room
   temperature, and refrigerated, covered, for up to 2 days.)
5. Transfer pork to large plate, season both sides with salt, and cover
   tightly with aluminum foil. Whisk sauce to combine. Transfer 1/2 cup to
   bowl for grilling; pour off all but 1/2 cup remaining sauce from pot and
   reserve for another use. Squeeze 2 lime wedges into sauce in pot and add
   spent wedges; season with salt to taste.
6. Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes.
   Turn all burners to medium.
7. Clean and oil cooking grate. Brush 1 side of pork with 1/4 cup reserved
   sauce. Place pork on 1 side of grill, sauce side down, and cook until
   well browned and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Brush pork with remaining 1/4
   cup reserved sauce, flip, and continue to cook until second side is well
   browned and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes longer. Transfer to cutting board.
   Meanwhile, brush both sides of pineapple rings with vegetable oil and
   season with salt to taste. Place on other half of grill and cook until
   pineapple is softened and caramelized, 5 to 7 minutes per side; transfer
   pineapple to cutting board.
8. Coarsely chop grilled pineapple and transfer to serving bowl. Using
   tongs or carving fork to steady hot pork, slice each piece crosswise
   into 1/8-inch pieces. Bring remaining 1/2 cup sauce in pot to simmer,
   add sliced pork, remove pot from heat, and toss to coat pork well.
   Season with salt to taste.
9. Spoon small amount of pork into each warm tortilla and serve, passing
   chopped pineapple, remaining 6 lime wedges, onion, and cilantro separately.

Notes
-----

Boneless pork butt is often labeled Boston butt. If you can't find guajillo
chiles, New Mexican chiles may be substituted, although the dish may be
spicier. To warm tortillas, place them on a plate, cover with a damp
kitchen towel, and microwave for 60 to 90 seconds. Keep tortillas covered
and serve immediately.

Bacon explosion
===============

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 pounds (900g) thick-cut sliced bacon
-  1 1/2 pounds (680g) Italian sausage, casings removed
-  3 tablespoons barbecue rub
-  3/4 cup barbecue sauce.

Directions
----------

1. Using 10 slices of bacon, weave a square lattice like that on top of
   a pie: first, place 5 bacon slices side by side on a large sheet of
   aluminum foil, parallel to one another, sides touching. Place another
   strip of bacon on one end, perpendicular to the other strips. Fold
   first, third and fifth bacon strips back over this new strip, then
   place another strip next to it, parallel to it. Unfold first, third
   and fifth strips; fold back second and fourth strips. Repeat with
   remaining bacon until all 10 strips are tightly woven.
2. Preheat oven to 225°F or light a fire in an outdoor smoker. Place
   remaining bacon in a frying pan and cook until crisp. As it cooks,
   sprinkle bacon weave with 1 tablespoon barbecue rub. evenly spread
   sausage on top of bacon lattice, pressing to outer edges.
3. Crumble fried bacon into bite-size pieces. Sprinkle on top of
   sausage. Drizzle with 1/2 cup barbecue sauce and sprinkle with
   another tablespoon barbecue rub.
4. Very carefully separate front edge of sausage layer from bacon weave
   and begin rolling sausage away from you. Bacon weave should stay
   where it was, flat. Press sausage roll to remove any air pockets and
   pinch together seams and ends.
5. Roll sausage toward you, this time with bacon weave, until it is
   completely wrapped. Turn it so seam faces down. Roll should be about
   2 to 3 inches thick. Sprinkle with remaining barbecue rub.
6. Place roll on a baking sheet in oven or in smoker. Cook until
   internal temperature reaches 165°F on a meat thermometer, about 1
   hour for each inch of thickness. When done, glaze roll with more
   sauce. To serve, slice into 1/4 to 1/2-inch rounds.

Ingredients
-----------
- Kosher salt and pepper
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 boneless center-cut pork loin roast, about 3 1/2 pounds (1.6kg)
- 1 recipe of `Peach Sauce <#peach-sauce>`__
- 2 teaspoons herbes de Provence
- 10 slices bacon

Directions
----------
1. Combine 4 teaspoons salt and sugar in bowl. Remove fat cap and silverskin
   from roast. Rub roast with salt-sugar mixture, wrap in plastic wrap, and
   refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours.
2. After making sauce, reserve 2 tablespoons of liquid portion of sauce
   (without peach segments) in small bowl for glazing. Cover and set aside
   remaining sauce.
3. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to
   250 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with
   vegetable oil spray. Unwrap roast and pat dry with paper towels. Sprinkle
   with herbes de Provence and 1 teaspoon pepper.
4. Arrange bacon slices on cutting board parallel to counter’s edge,
   overlapping them slightly to match length of roast. Place roast in center
   of bacon, perpendicular to slices. Bring ends of bacon up and around sides
   of roast, overlapping ends of slices as needed.
5. Place bacon-wrapped roast, seam side down, in center of prepared sheet.
   Roast until center of pork registers 90 degrees, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove
   roast from oven and increase oven temperature to 475 degrees.
6. Brush top and sides of roast with reserved 2 tablespoons sauce. Once oven
   reaches temperature, return pork to oven and roast until bacon is well
   browned and meat registers 130 degrees, 15 to 20 minutes longer. Transfer
   roast to wire rack and let rest for 15 minutes.
7. Transfer roast to carving board and cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices.
   Serve with peach sauce.

Broiled Pork Tenderloin for Two
===============================

-  Source: `Cooks
   Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/8032-broiled-pork-tenderloin-for-two>`__
   Recipes for broiled pork tenderloin promise roasts with well-browned
   exteriors and rosy-pink, juicy centers, but the results are more
   likely pallid, overcooked meat or spottily browned roasts with
   undercooked interiors. Using a disposable aluminum pan to cook the
   pork reflected the radiant heat of the broiler toward the pork,
   enhancing browning and ensuring that the interior didn’t overcook by
   the time deep browning had been achieved. Since some ovens preheat
   faster than others and are likely to cycle off if preheated at such
   an intense heat for too long, we evened the playing field by
   preheating the oven to 325°F before putting in the roast and turning
   on the broiler. And finally, because of the broiler’s intense heat,
   we found that there was a much bigger carryover cooking effect, so we
   pulled the roast from the oven when it hit 125°F to 130°F instead of
   our usual 140°F to ensure that it was a perfect medium-rare after its
   10-minute rest

Ingredients
-----------

-  1 pound (450g) pork tenderloin, trimmed
-  1 teaspoon kosher salt
-  3/4 teaspoon vegetable oil
-  1/4 teaspoon pepper
-  1/8 teaspoon baking soda
-  1 (13 by 9-inch) disposable aluminum roasting pan

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack 4 to 5 inches from broiler element and heat oven to
   325°F. Fold thin tip of tenderloin under about 2 inches to create
   uniformly shaped roast. Tie tenderloin crosswise with kitchen twine
   at 2-inch intervals, making sure folded tip is secured underneath.
   Trim any excess twine close to meat to prevent it from scorching
   under the broiler.
2. Mix salt, oil, and pepper in small bowl until salt is evenly coated
   with oil. Add baking soda and stir until well combined. Rub mixture
   evenly over pork. Place tenderloin in disposable pan.
3. Turn oven to broil. Immediately place meat in oven and broil
   tenderloin for 5 minutes. Flip tenderloin and continue to broil until
   golden brown and meat registers 125°F to 130°F, 8 to 14 minutes.
   Remove disposable pan from oven, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and
   let rest for 10 minutes. Remove twine, slice tenderloin into
   1/2-inch-thick slices, and serve.

Breaded Pork Cutlets (Pork Schnitzel)
=====================================

Ingredients
-----------

-  7 large high-quality sandwich bread, crusts removed, cut into
   3/4-inch cubes (about 4 cups)
-  1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
-  2 large eggs
-  2 cups plus 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
-  1 pork tenderloin (1 1/4 lb). trimmed of fat and silver skin and cut
   on angle into 4 equal pieces
-  Salt and ground black pepper

Garnishes
---------

-  1 lemon, cut into wedges
-  2 tablespoon chopped fresh flat leaf parsley leaves
-  2 tablespoons capers, rinsed

Directions
----------

1. Place bread cubes on large microwave-safe plate. Microwave on high
   power for 4 minutes, stirring well halfway through cooking time.
   Microwave on medium power until bread is dry and few pieces start to
   lightly brown, 3 to 5 minutes longer, stirring every minute. Process
   dry bread in food processor to very fine crumbs, about 45 seconds.
   Transfer bread crumbs to shallow dish (you should have about 11/4
   cups crumbs). Spread flour in second shallow dish. Beat eggs with 1
   tablespoon oil in third dish.
2. Place pork, with 1 cut-side down, between 2 sheets of parchment paper
   or plastic wrap and pound to even thickness between 1/8 and 1/4 inch.
   Season cutlets with salt and pepper. Working with 1 cutlet at a time,
   dredge cutlets thoroughly in flour, shaking off excess, then coat
   with egg mixture, allowing excess to drip back into dish to ensure
   very thin coating, and coat evenly with bread crumbs, pressing on
   crumbs to adhere. Place breaded cutlets in single layer on wire rack
   set over baking sheet; let coating dry 5 minutes.
3. Heat remaining 2 cups oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat
   until it registers 375°F on instant-read thermometer. Lay 2 cutlets,
   without overlapping, in pan and cook, shaking pan continuously and
   gently, until cutlets are wrinkled and light golden brown on both
   sides, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer cutlets to paper towel-lined
   plate and flip cutlets several times to blot excess oil. Repeat with
   remaining cutlets. Serve immediately with garnishes.

Notes
-----

In lieu of an instant-read thermometer to gauge the oil’s temperature,
place a fresh (not dry) bread cube in the oil and start heating; when
the bread is deep golden brown, the oil is ready.

Gochujang Pork Shoulder Steaks
==============================

Source: `Bon Appetit <https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/gochujang-pork-shoulder-steaks>`__

The centerpiece of Korean barbecue is the meat, but it doesn’t have to
be steak; Seattle chef Rachel Yang recommends grilling pork shoulder.
Keep an eye on the edge of the meat where it touches the grill: When
it’s browned, turn the pork over.

Serves 4

Ingredients
-----------

-  8 garlic cloves, peeled, crushed
-  1 2" piece ginger, peeled, sliced
-  1/2 cup dry sake
-  1/2 cup gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)
-  1/2 cup mirin (sweet Japanese rice wine)
-  1/4 cup vegetable oil, plus more for grilling
-  1 1/2 pound (680g) skinless, boneless pork shoulder (Boston butt), sliced 3/4" thick

Directions
----------

1. Puree garlic, ginger, sake, gochujang, mirin, and 1/4 cup oil in a
   blender. Set 1/4 cup marinade aside; chill. Transfer remaining
   marinade to a large dish. Add pork; turn to coat. Chill, turning
   occasionally, at least 2 hours. Can be marinated 1 day ahead. Keep
   chilled.
2. Prepare grill for medium-high heat; oil grate. Remove pork from
   marinade and grill, basting with reserved marinade, turning
   occasionally, and moving pork to a cooler area if flare-up occurs,
   until cooked to desired doneness, 8–10 minutes for medium-rare.
3. Transfer pork to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes before thinly
   slicing against the grain.

Crispy Slow-Roasted Pork Belly
==============================

+------------------------------------------------+-----------------------+
| Total: 4 to 4 1/2 hours, plus 12 hours brining | Yield: Serves 8 to 10 |
+------------------------------------------------+-----------------------+

Source: `Cook's Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/8116-crispy-slow-roasted-pork-belly>`__


Ingredients
-----------

- 1 (3-pound) skin-on center-cut fresh pork belly, about 1 1/2 inches thick
- Kosher salt
- 2 tablespoons packed dark brown sugar
- Vegetable oil

Directions
----------

1. Using sharp chef's knife, slice pork belly lengthwise into 3 strips
   about 2 inches wide, then make 1/4-inch-deep crosswise cuts through skin
   and into fat spaced 1/2 inch apart. Combine 2 tablespoons salt and brown
   sugar in small bowl. Rub salt mixture into bottom and sides of pork
   belly (do not rub into skin). Season skin of each strip evenly with 1/2
   teaspoon salt. Place pork belly, skin side up, in 13 by 9-inch baking
   dish and refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 12 hours or up to 24
   hours.
2. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 250 degrees.
   Transfer pork belly, skin side up, to lightly greased wire rack set in
   rimmed baking sheet. Roast pork belly until meat registers 195 degrees
   and paring knife inserted in meat meets little resistance, 3 to 3 1/2
   hours, rotating sheet halfway through roasting.
3. Transfer pork belly, skin side up, to large plate. (Pork belly can be
   held at room temperature for up to 1 hour.) Pour fat from sheet into
   1-cup liquid measuring cup. Add vegetable oil as needed to equal 1 cup
   and transfer to 12-inch skillet. Arrange pork belly, skin side down, in
   skillet (strips can be sliced in half crosswise if skillet won't fit
   strips whole) and place over medium heat until bubbles form around pork
   belly. Continue to fry, tilting skillet occasionally to even out hot
   spots, until skin puffs, crisps, and turns golden, 6 to 10 minutes.
   Transfer pork belly, skin side up, to carving board and let rest for 5
   minutes. Flip pork belly on its side and slice 1/2 inch thick (being
   sure to slice through original score marks). Reinvert slices and serve.

Notes
-----

This recipe requires seasoning and refrigerating the pork belly for at
least 12 hours before cooking. Be sure to ask for a flat, rectangular
center-cut section of skin-on pork belly that's 1 1/2 inches thick with
roughly equal amounts of meat and fat. Serve the meat in small portions
with our `Spicy Mustard Sauce <#spicy-mustard-sauce>`__,
`Sweet and Sour Chile Sauce <#sweet-and-sour-chile-sauce>`__, or
`Tangy Hoisin Sauce <#tangy-hoisin-sauce>`__, plus white rice and steamed
greens or boiled potatoes and salad.
