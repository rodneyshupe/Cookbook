Barbecue Ribs
=============

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 racks pork ribs (I prefer to use side ribs)
-  1 cup `Basic Barbecue Rub <#basic-barbecue-rub>`__
-  1 cup `Kansas City Style Sweet and Smoky Barbecue Sauce <#kansas-city-style-sweet-and-smoky-barbecue-sauce>`__
-  2 cups wood chips, preferably apple wood, soaked in 2 cups apple
   cider for 1 hour then drained

Directions
----------

1. Remove the papery skin on the back of each rack of ribs by pulling it
   off in a sheet with your fingers or a pair of pliers.
2. Sprinkle the ribs on both sides with two thirds of the rub patting it
   in with your fingers. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 -
   4 hours.
3. Set up the grill for indirect grilling. If using a charcoal grill,
   toss the wood chips on the coals. If using a gas grill, place the
   chips in a smoker box. Don’t grill until you see smoke.
4. Place the ribs in the center of the grill away from the fire.
   Indirect Grill for about 1 hour. The temperature should be around
   325°F.
5. Brush ribs with half of the cup of Barbecue sauce. (Set aside the
   other half for serving on the side at the table.)
6. Increase the heat and continue indirect grilling until the ribs are
   done 15-30 minutes. When done the meat will be very tender and will
   have pulled back from the ends of the bones.
7. Transfer the ribs to a platter. Sprinkle with the remaining rub and
   serve with the other half cup of barbecue sauce.

Chinese-Style Barbecued Spareribs
=================================

+----------------+----------------+-------------------------+
| Prep Time: 10  | Cooking Time:  | Yield: 6-8 as Appetizer |
| minutes        | 2 hours        | 4-6 as main course      |
+----------------+----------------+-------------------------+

Source: `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/10314-chinese-style-barbecued-spareribs#>`__

Ingredients
-----------

-  1 (6-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and sliced thin
-  8 garlic cloves, peeled
-  1 cup honey
-  3/4 cup hoisin sauce
-  3/4 cup soy sauce
-  1/2 cup Chinese rice wine or dry sherry
-  2 teaspoons five-spice powder
-  1 teaspoon red food coloring (optional)
-  1 teaspoon ground white pepper
-  2 racks St. Louis-style spareribs, 2 1/2 to 3 pound (1.1 to 1.4 kg), cut into individual ribs
-  2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil

Directions
----------

1. Pulse ginger and garlic in food processor until finely chopped, 10 to
   12 pulses, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Transfer
   ginger-garlic mixture to Dutch oven. Add honey; hoisin; soy sauce;
   1/2 cup water; rice wine; five-spice powder; food coloring, if using;
   and pepper and whisk until combined. Add ribs and stir to coat (ribs
   will not be fully submerged). Bring to simmer over high heat, then
   reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 1 1/4 hours, stirring
   occasionally.
2. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425°F.
   Using tongs, transfer ribs to large bowl. Strain braising liquid
   through fine-mesh strainer set over large container, pressing on
   solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard solids. Let
   cooking liquid settle for 10 minutes. Using wide, shallow spoon, skim
   fat from surface and discard.
3. Return braising liquid to pot and add sesame oil. Bring to boil over
   high heat and cook until syrupy and reduced to 2 1/2 cups, 16 to 20
   minutes.
4. Set wire rack in aluminum foil–lined rimmed baking sheet and pour 1/2
   cup water into sheet. Transfer half of ribs to pot with braising
   liquid and toss to coat. Arrange ribs, bone sides up, on prepared
   rack, letting excess glaze drip off. Roast until edges of ribs start
   to caramelize, 5 to 7 minutes. Flip ribs and continue to roast until
   second side starts to caramelize, 5 to 7 minutes longer. Transfer
   ribs to serving platter; repeat process with remaining ribs. Serve.

Make Ahead
----------

At end of step 3, refrigerate ribs and glaze separately, covered, for up
to 2 days. When ready to serve, bring glaze and half of ribs to simmer
in Dutch oven over medium heat, then proceed with step 4. Repeat with
remaining ribs.

Notes
-----

It’s not necessary to remove the membrane on the bone side of the ribs.
These ribs are chewier than American-style ribs; if you prefer them more
tender, cook them for an additional 15 minutes in step 1. Adding water
to the baking sheet during roasting helps prevent smoking. Serve the
ribs alone as an appetizer or with vegetables and rice as a main course.
You can serve the first batch immediately or tent them with foil to keep
them warm.

Indoor Pulled Pork
==================

+------------------------+-----------------------+---------------------+
| Prep Time: 2 1/2 hours | Cooking Time: 5 hours | Yield: 6-8 servings |
+------------------------+-----------------------+---------------------+

Ingredients
-----------

Pork
^^^^

-  1 cup plus 2 teaspoons table salt
-  1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
-  3 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons liquid smoke
-  1 boneless pork butt, about 5 pounds (2.3kg), cut in half horizontally (see step by step below)
-  1/4 cup yellow mustard
-  2 tablespoons ground black pepper
-  2 tablespoons smoked paprika (see note)
-  1 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Sweet and Tangy Barbecue Sauce
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  1 1/2 cups ketchup
-  1/4 cup light or mild molasses
-  2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
-  1 tablespoon hot sauce
-  1/2 teaspoon table salt
-  1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions
----------

Pork
^^^^

1. For the pork: Dissolve 1 cup salt, 1/2 cup sugar, and 3 tablespoons
   liquid smoke in 4 quarts cold water in large container. Submerge pork
   in brine, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 2 hours.
2. While pork brines, combine mustard and remaining 2 teaspoons liquid
   smoke in small bowl; set aside. Combine black pepper, paprika,
   remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, remaining 2 teaspoons salt, and
   cayenne in second small bowl; set aside. Adjust oven rack to
   lower-middle position and heat oven to 325°F.
3. Remove pork from brine and dry thoroughly with paper towels. Rub
   mustard mixture over entire surface of each piece of pork. Sprinkle
   entire surface of each piece with spice mixture. Place pork on wire
   rack set inside foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Place piece of
   parchment paper over pork, then cover with sheet of aluminum foil,
   sealing edges to prevent moisture from escaping. Roast pork for 3
   hours.
4. Remove pork from oven; remove and discard foil and parchment.
   Carefully pour off liquid in bottom of baking sheet into fat
   separator and reserve for sauce. Return pork to oven and cook,
   uncovered, until well browned, tender, and internal temperature
   registers 200°F on instant-read thermometer, about 1 1/2 hours.
   Transfer pork to serving dish, tent loosely with foil, and let rest
   for 20 minutes.
5. To serve: Using 2°Forks, shred pork into bite-sized pieces. Toss with
   1 cup sauce and season with salt and pepper. Serve, passing remaining
   sauce separately.

Sweet and Tangy Sauce
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. While pork rests, pour 1/2 cup of defatted cooking liquid from fat
   separator into medium bowl; whisk in sauce ingredients.

Notes
-----

Sweet paprika may be substituted for smoked paprika. Covering the pork
with parchment and then foil prevents the acidic mustard from eating
holes in the foil. Serve the pork on hamburger rolls with pickle chips
and thinly sliced onion. As an alternative to the Sweet and Tangy
Barbecue Sauce, use 2 cups of your favorite barbecue sauce thinned with
1/2 cup of the defatted pork cooking liquid in step 5. The shredded and
sauced pork can be cooled, tightly covered, and refrigerated for up to 2
days. Reheat it gently before serving.

   a pie: first, place 5 bacon slices side by side on a large sheet of
   aluminum foil, parallel to one another, sides touching. Place another
   strip of bacon on one end, perpendicular to the other strips. Fold
   first, third and fifth bacon strips back over this new strip, then
   place another strip next to it, parallel to it. Unfold first, third
   and fifth strips; fold back second and fourth strips. Repeat with
   remaining bacon until all 10 strips are tightly woven.
2. Preheat oven to 225°F or light a fire in an outdoor smoker. Place

   sausage. Drizzle with 1/2 cup barbecue sauce and sprinkle with
   another tablespoon barbecue rub.
4. Very carefully separate front edge of sausage layer from bacon weave
   and begin rolling sausage away from you. Bacon weave should stay
   where it was, flat. Press sausage roll to remove any air pockets and
   pinch together seams and ends.
5. Roll sausage toward you, this time with bacon weave, until it is
   completely wrapped. Turn it so seam faces down. Roll should be about
   2 to 3 inches thick. Sprinkle with remaining barbecue rub.
6. Place roll on a baking sheet in oven or in smoker. Cook until
   internal temperature reaches 165°F on a meat thermometer, about 1
   hour for each inch of thickness. When done, glaze roll with more
   sauce. To serve, slice into 1/4 to 1/2-inch rounds.

Broiled Pork Tenderloin for Two
===============================

-  Source: `Cooks
   Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/8032-broiled-pork-tenderloin-for-two>`__
   Recipes for broiled pork tenderloin promise roasts with well-browned
   exteriors and rosy-pink, juicy centers, but the results are more
   likely pallid, overcooked meat or spottily browned roasts with
   undercooked interiors. Using a disposable aluminum pan to cook the
   pork reflected the radiant heat of the broiler toward the pork,
   enhancing browning and ensuring that the interior didn’t overcook by
   the time deep browning had been achieved. Since some ovens preheat
   faster than others and are likely to cycle off if preheated at such
   an intense heat for too long, we evened the playing field by
   preheating the oven to 325°F before putting in the roast and turning
   on the broiler. And finally, because of the broiler’s intense heat,
   we found that there was a much bigger carryover cooking effect, so we
   pulled the roast from the oven when it hit 125°F to 130°F instead of
   our usual 140°F to ensure that it was a perfect medium-rare after its
   10-minute rest

Ingredients
-----------

-  1 pound (450g) pork tenderloin, trimmed
-  1 teaspoon kosher salt
-  3/4 teaspoon vegetable oil
-  1/4 teaspoon pepper
-  1/8 teaspoon baking soda
-  1 (13 by 9-inch) disposable aluminum roasting pan

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack 4 to 5 inches from broiler element and heat oven to
   325°F. Fold thin tip of tenderloin under about 2 inches to create
   uniformly shaped roast. Tie tenderloin crosswise with kitchen twine
   at 2-inch intervals, making sure folded tip is secured underneath.
   Trim any excess twine close to meat to prevent it from scorching
   under the broiler.
2. Mix salt, oil, and pepper in small bowl until salt is evenly coated
   with oil. Add baking soda and stir until well combined. Rub mixture
   evenly over pork. Place tenderloin in disposable pan.
3. Turn oven to broil. Immediately place meat in oven and broil
   tenderloin for 5 minutes. Flip tenderloin and continue to broil until
   golden brown and meat registers 125°F to 130°F, 8 to 14 minutes.
   Remove disposable pan from oven, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and
   let rest for 10 minutes. Remove twine, slice tenderloin into
   1/2-inch-thick slices, and serve.

Breaded Pork Cutlets (Pork Schnitzel)
=====================================

Ingredients
-----------

-  7 large high-quality sandwich bread, crusts removed, cut into
   3/4-inch cubes (about 4 cups)
-  1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
-  2 large eggs
-  2 cups plus 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
-  1 pork tenderloin (1 1/4 lb). trimmed of fat and silver skin and cut
   on angle into 4 equal pieces
-  Salt and ground black pepper

Garnishes
---------

-  1 lemon, cut into wedges
-  2 tablespoon chopped fresh flat leaf parsley leaves
-  2 tablespoons capers, rinsed

Directions
----------

1. Place bread cubes on large microwave-safe plate. Microwave on high
   power for 4 minutes, stirring well halfway through cooking time.
   Microwave on medium power until bread is dry and few pieces start to
   lightly brown, 3 to 5 minutes longer, stirring every minute. Process
   dry bread in food processor to very fine crumbs, about 45 seconds.
   Transfer bread crumbs to shallow dish (you should have about 11/4
   cups crumbs). Spread flour in second shallow dish. Beat eggs with 1
   tablespoon oil in third dish.
2. Place pork, with 1 cut-side down, between 2 sheets of parchment paper
   or plastic wrap and pound to even thickness between 1/8 and 1/4 inch.
   Season cutlets with salt and pepper. Working with 1 cutlet at a time,
   dredge cutlets thoroughly in flour, shaking off excess, then coat
   with egg mixture, allowing excess to drip back into dish to ensure
   very thin coating, and coat evenly with bread crumbs, pressing on
   crumbs to adhere. Place breaded cutlets in single layer on wire rack
   set over baking sheet; let coating dry 5 minutes.
3. Heat remaining 2 cups oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat
   until it registers 375°F on instant-read thermometer. Lay 2 cutlets,
   without overlapping, in pan and cook, shaking pan continuously and
   gently, until cutlets are wrinkled and light golden brown on both
   sides, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer cutlets to paper towel-lined
   plate and flip cutlets several times to blot excess oil. Repeat with
   remaining cutlets. Serve immediately with garnishes.

Notes
-----

In lieu of an instant-read thermometer to gauge the oil’s temperature,
place a fresh (not dry) bread cube in the oil and start heating; when
the bread is deep golden brown, the oil is ready.

-  8 medium cloves garlic, peeled
-  1 tablespoon kosher salt or 1 1/2 teaspoons table salt
-  1/2 tablespoon ground black pepper
-  1/4 cup olive oil

Glaze
-----

-  1 Glaze (see glaze ingredients)

Orange, Cinnamon, and Star Anise Glaze
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  1 cup orange juice
-  1 tablespoon grated orange zest
-  2 cups packed brown sugar (dark or light)
-  4 star anise (pods)
-  1 cinnamon stick (3-inches)

Spicy Pineapple-Ginger Glaze
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  1 cup pineapple juice
-  2 cups packed brown sugar (dark or light)
-  1 inch piece fresh ginger, grated (about 1 tablespoon)
-  1 tablespoon red pepper flakes

Apple Cider and Brown Sugar Glaze
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  1 cup apple cider
-  2 cups packed brown sugar (dark or light)
-  5 whole cloves

Directions
----------

1. Carefully slice through skin and fat with serrated knife, making
   1-inch diamond pattern. Be careful not to cut into meat.
2. In large (about 16-quart) bucket or stockpot, dissolve salt and brown
   sugar in 1 gallon hot tap water. Add garlic, bay leaves, black
   pepper, and 1 gallon cold water. Submerge ham in brine and
   refrigerate 8 to 24 hours.
3. Set large disposable roasting pan on baking sheet for extra support;
   place flat wire rack in roasting pan. Remove ham from brine; rinse
   under cold water and dry thoroughly with paper towels. Place ham,
   wide cut-side down, on rack. (If using sirloin end, place ham
   skin-side up.) Let ham stand, uncovered, at room temperature 1 hour.
4. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to
   500°F. In work bowl of food processor fitted with steel blade,
   process sage, parsley, garlic, salt, pepper, and oil until mixture
   forms smooth paste, about 30 seconds. Rub all sides of ham with
   paste.
5. Roast ham at 500°F for 20 minutes. While ham is roasting make the
   glaze. Bring all glaze ingredients to boil in small nonreactive
   saucepan over high heat; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until
   syrupy and reduced to about 1 1/3 cups, 5 to 7 minutes. (Glaze will
   thicken as it cools between bastings; cook over medium heat about 1
   minute, stirring once or twice, before using.)
6. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F and continue to roast, brushing ham
   with glaze every 45 minutes, until center of ham registers 145°F to
   150°F on instant-read thermometer (see illustration below for
   thermometer placement), about 2 1/2 hours longer. Tent ham loosely
   with foil and let stand until center of ham registers 155°F to 160°F
   on thermometer, 30 to 40 minutes. Carve, following instructions
   below, and serve.

Gochujang Pork Shoulder Steaks
==============================

Source: `Bon Appetit <https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/gochujang-pork-shoulder-steaks>`__

The centerpiece of Korean barbecue is the meat, but it doesn’t have to
be steak; Seattle chef Rachel Yang recommends grilling pork shoulder.
Keep an eye on the edge of the meat where it touches the grill: When
it’s browned, turn the pork over.

Serves 4

Ingredients
-----------

-  8 garlic cloves, peeled, crushed
-  1 2" piece ginger, peeled, sliced
-  1/2 cup dry sake
-  1/2 cup gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)
-  1/2 cup mirin (sweet Japanese rice wine)
-  1/4 cup vegetable oil, plus more for grilling
-  1 1/2 pound (680g) skinless, boneless pork shoulder (Boston butt), sliced 3/4" thick

Directions
----------

1. Puree garlic, ginger, sake, gochujang, mirin, and 1/4 cup oil in a
   blender. Set 1/4 cup marinade aside; chill. Transfer remaining
   marinade to a large dish. Add pork; turn to coat. Chill, turning
   occasionally, at least 2 hours. Can be marinated 1 day ahead. Keep
   chilled.
2. Prepare grill for medium-high heat; oil grate. Remove pork from
   marinade and grill, basting with reserved marinade, turning
   occasionally, and moving pork to a cooler area if flare-up occurs,
   until cooked to desired doneness, 8–10 minutes for medium-rare.
3. Transfer pork to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes before thinly
   slicing against the grain.

- 1/3 cup diced jarred banana peppers
- 4 potato sandwich rolls (Kaiser rolls can be substituted)
- 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 1 1/2 tablespoons yellow mustard, such as French's
- 1/4 pound (113g) thinly sliced baked ham, preferably Virginia or Black Forest
- 1/2 pound (225g) cold roast pork, sliced thin
- 1/4 pound (113g) thinly sliced Swiss cheese
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

Directions
----------
1. Combine pickles and peppers in small bowl. Split rolls in half; spread top
   half with mayonnaise and bottom half with mustard. Layer ham, roast pork,
   pickle mixture, and cheese onto bottom half, finishing with cheese on top.
   Set tops of rolls in place and press down to flatten sandwiches.
2. Heat large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat for 4 minutes. Meanwhile,
   heat large pot or Dutch oven over medium-low heat for 4 minutes. Brush
   tops of sandwiches with melted butter and place in skillet buttered side
   down. Brush bottoms of rolls with remaining butter and use preheated pot
   to compress sandwiches for 15 to 20 seconds. Cook (keeping pot on
   sandwiches but not pressing down) until first side is golden brown, 3 to
   5 minutes. Remove pot, flip sandwiches over, replace pot on top of
   sandwiches, and cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes.
   Serve immediately.
