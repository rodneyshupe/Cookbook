===================

Ingredients
-----------

-  3/4 cups `teriyaki sauce <#teriyaki-sauce>`__
-  3/8 cups brown sugar
-  3/4 tbs hickory flavor liquid smoke
-  1/2 tbs onion powder
-  1/2 tbs garlic powder
-  1/2 tbs pepper (optional)

Directions
----------

1. Mix your teriyaki sauce and liquid smoke together in a medium size
   pot. Heat the mixture on your stove until it gets hot to the touch,
   then add your brown sugar and stir it for about 5 minutes. This helps
   dissolve the sugar completely. Allow the mixture to cool to room
   temperature.
