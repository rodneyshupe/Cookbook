Jerky Recipes
*************

Historically, jerking meat was the primary means of preservation before
refrigeration. True jerking is drying meat, that was previously brined
in a heavy salt solution. In fact the word ‘jerk’ comes from the old
Spanish word ‘charqui’ which means dried meat.

Homemade Jerky
==============

+-----------------------+----------------------+-------------------------+
| Prep Time: 20 minutes | Marinade: 8-24 hours |  Drying Time: 6-8 hours |
+-----------------------+----------------------+-------------------------+

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 1/4 lbs (1kg) Beef, flank, top round or any other cheaper non-fatty
   type works best
-  Marinade

Preparation
-----------

1. **Meat**: Trim as much of the fat off as possible. Slice the meat
   with the grain into 3-6 mm (1/8" - 1/4“) thick strips. You may use
   any cut of meat you like but remember that meat with a high fat
   content will become rancid faster. Top round steak or flank steak
   work well. To save time you can buy eye of round rouladin cut. Also
   to make slicing easier partially freeze meet for 2-3 hours. In the
   case of tough cuts or wild game you may want to also pound with a
   mallet.
2. **Marinade**: Combine the Marinade ingredients and coat strips of
   meat with marinade and place in a glass or plastic (non-metallic)
   container (a 1 gallon ziplock bag work well), cover and refrigerate
   overnight.

Dehydration
-----------

1. Remove meat strips from refrigerator, place on oiled smoker racks and
   allow to air dry for at least one hour.
2. If marinade uses liquid smoke you can just dehydrate the meat in the
   smoker or oven at approx. 70°C (160°F). If using the smoker ensure
   the vent is fully open and no water in the drip bowl. If using the
   oven leave the door open slightly using a wooden spoon to allow
   moisture to escape.
3. If smoke is required use smoker as above but use hickory flavor
   bisquettes for 2-3 hours and then just heat for remaining time.
4. Dehydration can take approximately 6 to 8 hours. But rotate the racks
   every hour.
5. Your jerky is ready when you are able to tear the strips along the
   grain, they should be pliable but not soft and fairly stiff but not
   brittle.
6. Store your jerky in a clean and dry container lined with a paper
   towel and a loose fitting lid. Jerky is shelf stable for about 2
   weeks at room temperature and one month in the refrigerator.
