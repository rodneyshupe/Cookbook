Grilled Ceaser Salad
====================

Yield: 12 Servings

Ingredients
-----------
- 3 cups cubed French bread, about 1 ½-inch cubes
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
- 2 heads (or 3 hearts) romaine lettuce, quartered through the core
- 4 lemons, halved
- 2 teaspoons anchovy paste
- 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
- 1–2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- Parmigiano Reggiano shavings
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper


Directions
----------
1. Preheat your grill or a griddle pan to medium and toss the bread into
   a bowl and set aside. In a small microwave safe dish, melt together
   the butter, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and garlic powder for 15 to 20
   seconds. Drizzle this over the bread, season with salt and pepper,
   and toss well to combine. Transfer the bread cubes onto the grill or
   griddle pan and toast, turning frequently, until the croutons are
   golden and just starting to char. Transfer them to a bowl and set aside.
2. Drizzle the remaining tablespoon of oil evenly over the quartered
   romaine heads and season with a small pinch of salt. Place the romaine
   quarters and lemon halves cut side down onto the grill and cook for
   2 minutes or so or until the greens and lemons are starting to char.
   Remove the lemons and lettuce from the heat and transfer the romaine to
   a serving platter grilled side up and set aside.
3. For the dressing, whisk the anchovy paste, mustard, and garlic together
   in the bottom of a large mixing bowl. Whisk in the red wine vinegar and
   3 to 4 tablespoons of juice from one of the lemon halves that you just
   grilled. Continue whisking and slowly drizzle in the extra virgin olive
   oil then season with salt and pepper to taste.
4. Drizzle the romaine with dressing, making sure that some of that
   yumminess gets in between the layers of leaves. Scatter the croutons
   across the top along with some Parmigiano Reggiano shavings, season
   with a bit more pepper, and arrange the grilled lemons around the
   platter for serving.

Austrian Potato Salad
=====================

+-----------------------+--------------------------+-----------------------+
| Prep Time: 15 minutes | Cooking Time: 30 minutes | Yield: 4 - 6 servings |
+-----------------------+--------------------------+-----------------------+

For a creamy and light potato salad recipe, do as the Austrians do:
Ditch the mayo and look to the soup pot. The finished salad should be
creamy and loose, with chunks of potato that keep their shape but are
very tender.

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes (about 4 large), peeled, quartered
   lengthwise, and cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices
-  1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
-  1 cup water
-  Table salt
-  1 tablespoon sugar
-  2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
-  1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
-  1/4 cup vegetable oil
-  1 small red onion, chopped fine (about 3/4 cup)
-  6 cornichons, minced (about 2 tablespoons)
-  2 tablespoons minced fresh chives
-  Ground black pepper

Directions
----------

1. Bring potatoes, broth, water, 1 teaspoon salt, sugar, and 1
   tablespoon vinegar to boil in 12-inch heavy-bottomed skillet over
   high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until potatoes
   offer no resistance when pierced with paring knife, 15 to 17 minutes.
   Remove cover, increase heat to high (so cooking liquid will reduce),
   and cook 2 minutes.
2. Drain potatoes in colander set over large bowl, reserving cooking
   liquid. Set drained potatoes aside. Pour off and discard all but 1/2
   cup cooking liquid (if 1/2 cup liquid does not remain, add water to
   make 1/2 cup). Whisk remaining tablespoon vinegar, mustard, and oil
   into cooking liquid.
3. Add 1/2 cup cooked potatoes to bowl with cooking liquid mixture and
   mash with potato masher or fork until thick sauce forms (mixture will
   be slightly chunky). Add remaining potatoes, onion, cornichons, and
   chives, folding gently with rubber spatula to combine. Season to
   taste with salt and black pepper. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Notes
-----

If you can’t find cornichons, chopped kosher dill pickles can be used in
their place.

To maintain its consistency, don’t refrigerate the salad; it should be
served within 4 hours of preparation.

   until mostly cooled, about 10 minutes.
2. Toss with potatoes with mayonnaise, mustard, lemon juice, jalapeno,
   dill, parsley, and black pepper. Taste and adjust seasonings, if
   necessary, with more salt and pepper.
3. Serve at room temperature or make in advance and keep cold in the
   refrigerator.

Mexican Corn Salad (Esquites)
=============================

Source: `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/11067-mexican-corn-salad-esquites>`__

Yield:  Serves 3-4

Ingredients
-----------
1 1/2 tablespoons lime juice, plus extra for seasoning (2 limes)
1 1/2 tablespoons sour cream
1/2 tablespoon mayonnaise
1 serrano chiles, stemmed and cut into 1/8-inch-thick rings
Salt
1 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon vegetable oil
3 ears corn, kernels cut from cobs (3 cups)
1 garlic cloves, minced
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
2 ounces cotija cheese, crumbled (1/2 cup)
1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro leaves
1 scallions, sliced thin

Directions
----------
1. Combine lime juice, sour cream, mayonnaise, serrano(s), and
   1/8 teaspoon salt in large bowl. Set aside.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat until
   shimmering. Add corn and spread into even layer. Sprinkle with
   1/4 teaspoon salt. Cover and cook, without stirring, until corn touching
   skillet is charred, about 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and let
   stand, covered, for 15 seconds, until any popping subsides. Transfer
   corn to bowl with sour cream mixture. If doubling the recipe repeat with
   1 tablespoon oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and additional corn.
3. Return now-empty skillet to medium heat and add remaining
   1/2 teaspoon oil, garlic, and chili powder. Cook, stirring constantly,
   until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer garlic mixture to bowl with
   corn mixture and toss to combine. Let cool for at least 15 minutes.
4. Add cotija, cilantro, and scallions and toss to combine. Season salad
   with salt and up to 1 tablespoon extra lime juice to taste. Serve.

Notes
-----
If desired, substitute plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream. I like serrano
chiles here, but you can substitute a jalapeño chile that has been halved
lengthwise and sliced into 1/8-inch-thick half-moons. Adjust the amount of
chiles to suit your taste. If cotija cheese is unavailable, substitute
feta cheese.

Variations
----------

**Papaya, Clementine, and Chayote:**

Change red pepper flakes with 2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger. Use 1
chayote (also called mirliton) instead of jicama, if you can find it,

seeded, and cut into 1/2-inch dice (4 cups) and switch the oranges with
3 clementines, peeled, each segment cut into 3 pieces

grapefruit in place of the orange. Replace 1 pineapple, peeled, cored,
