Ingredients
-----------

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 3 celery root bulbs, peeled and cubed
- 2 fennel bulbs, trimmed and cubed
- 2 cloves garlic or 2 tablespoons minced garlic scapes
- Kosher salt
- 2 cups loosely packed fresh parsley leaves, plus chopped parsley, for serving
- 1 cup plain yogurt, plus more for serving
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
- Bacon bits, for serving

Directions
----------

1. Put a stockpot over high heat and add the olive oil. Add the celery
   root, fennel and garlic and saute until beginning to brown, about 3
   minutes. Season liberally with salt and add enough water to cover all
   the vegetables with a little to spare. Bring to a boil, then simmer
   until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Allow to cool for
   about 30 minutes.
2. Add the cooled vegetables with their liquid to a blender. Add the
   parsley, yogurt, lemon juice and more salt as needed and blend well.
   Serve cold with a drizzle of yogurt, some chopped parsley and bacon
   bits. It's best the second or third day.
