Ingredients
-----------

- Neutral oil
- 1/2 white onion, diced
- 1 cup fennel, diced
- 1 jalapeno, sliced into thin rings (seeds left in)
- 1 red pepper, diced
- 5 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon celery seed
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 1/2 cups dry white wine
- 28 ounce can crushed tomatoes
- 1 - 10 ounce bottle clam juice
- 16 ounces Clamato juice
- 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon coarse ground black
- 1 pound large shrimp, peeled & de-veined
- 1 1/2 pounds cod/halibut/rockfish - any firm white fish
- 1 pound large scallops, sliced into thin half horizontally
- 1 pound mussels, rinsed, beards removed
- Chopped parsley and diced green onion for garnish
- Crusty bread for serving

Directions
----------

1. Heat a couple tablespoons of oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat,
   and add the onion, fennel, jalapenos and red pepper - cook until
   softened 4-5 minutes
2. Add the garlic and mix in until fragrant, about 45 seconds
3. Add the celery seed, red pepper flakes, smoked paprika and let it infuse
   in the oil about a minute, then stir in the tomato paste – mix in well
4. Add the wine, bring to a simmer and cook 2-3 minutes or until wine is
   mostly evaporated
5. Now you can add the tomatoes, clam juice and Clamato juice, mix well,
   return to a simmer and cover for 10 – 15 minutes
6. Add salt and pepper to taste, reduce heat to low then add the fish, and
   gently dunk into the broth - cover for 2 minutes
7. Now add everything else giving them a gentle push into the broth – you
   don’t want to break the fish
8. Bring to a simmer, cover and let poach for 3-4 mins or until the mussels
   are fully opened and the rest of the fish is opaque – if you need more
   time, just cover it up again
9. When ready, gently ladle into a bowl (discarding any mussels that didn’t
   open) and garnish with the parsley & green onion
10. Serve with the  bread
