+-----------------------+--------------------------+---------------------+


Ingredients
-----------

-  3 tablespoons unsalted butter
-  1 medium yellow onion, coarsely chopped
-  2 medium celery stalks, coarsely chopped
-  1 1/2 pounds rutabaga, peeled and coarsely chopped (about 4 1/4 cups)
-  4 cups (1 quart) low-sodium vegetable broth
-  2 cups half-and-half
-  2 1/2 teaspoons high-quality smoked paprika
-  1 teaspoon ground white pepper

Directions
----------

1. Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Once butter foams, add
   onion and celery, and season generously with salt. Cook, stirring
   occasionally, until vegetables are tender but not browned, about 5
   minutes.
2. Add rutabaga and broth, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and
   simmer until rutabaga is tender when pierced with a fork, about 30
   minutes. Add half-and-half, paprika, and white pepper and stir to
   combine.
3. Allow soup to cool slightly, then puree in a blender until smooth.
   (You will have to do this in batches.) Taste and season with more
   salt and white pepper as needed.
