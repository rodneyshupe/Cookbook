Ingredients
-----------

-  4 tablespoons unsalted butter
-  8 medium shallots (about 5 ounces), minced (about 1 cup), or 1 medium
   leek, white and light green parts chopped fine (about 1 1/3 cups)
-  2 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour
-  3 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
-  1 1/2 pounds frozen peas (about 4 1/2 cups), partially thawed at room
   temperature for 10 minutes (see note)
-  12 leaves Boston lettuce (about 3 ounces) from 1 small head, leaves
   washed and dried
-  1/2 cup heavy cream
-  Salt and ground black pepper

Directions
----------

1. Heat butter in large saucepan over low heat until foaming; add
   shallots or leeks and cook, covered, until softened, 8 to 10 minutes,
   stirring occasionally. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until
   thoroughly combined, about 30 seconds. Stirring constantly, gradually
   add chicken broth. Increase heat to high and bring to boil; reduce
   heat to medium-low and simmer 3 to 5 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, in workbowl of food processor fitted with steel blade,
   process partially thawed peas until coarsely chopped, about 20
   seconds. Add peas and lettuce to simmering broth. Increase heat to
   medium-high, cover and return to simmer; simmer 3 minutes. Uncover,
   reduce heat to medium-low, and continue to simmer 2 minutes longer.
3. Working in 2 batches, puree soup in blender until smooth; strain into
   large bowl. Rinse out and wipe saucepan; return pureed mixture to
   saucepan and stir in cream. Heat mixture over low heat until hot,
   about 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper; serve
   immediately.
