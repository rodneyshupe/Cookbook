Rouille and Croutons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  3 tablespoons water
-  1/4 teaspoon saffron threads
-  1 baguette
-  4 teaspoons juice from 1 lemon
-  2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
-  1 large egg yolk
-  1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
-  2 small cloves garlic, minced or pressed through garlic press (about

Directions
----------

1. *For the Bouillabaisse:* Adjust oven racks to middle and lower
   positions and heat oven to 375°F. Pat chicken dry with paper
   towels and season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in large Dutch oven
   over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add chicken pieces,
   skin-side down, and cook without moving until well browned, 5 to 8
   minutes. Using tongs, flip chicken and brown other side, about 3
   minutes. Transfer chicken to large plate.
2. Add leek and fennel; cook, stirring often, until vegetables begin to
   soften and turn translucent, about 4 minutes. Add saffron, cayenne,
   flour, garlic, and tomato paste and cook until fragrant, about 30
   seconds. Add tomatoes, wine, broth, orange zest, pastis, and
   potatoes; bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 10
   minutes.
3. Nestle chicken thighs and drumsticks into simmering liquid with skin
   above surface of liquid; cook, uncovered, 5 minutes. Nestle breast
   pieces into simmering liquid, adjusting pieces as necessary to ensure
   skin stays above surface of liquid. Bake on middle rack, uncovered,
   until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of chicken
   registers 145°F for breasts and 160°F for drumsticks and thighs,
   10 to 20 minutes.
4. *For the Rouille:* While chicken cooks, microwave water and saffron
   in medium microwave-safe bowl on high power until water is steaming,
   10 to 20 seconds. Allow to sit 5 minutes. Cut 3-inch piece off of
   baguette; remove and discard crust. Tear crustless bread into 1-inch
   chunks (you should have about 1 cup). Stir bread pieces and lemon
   juice into saffron-infused water; soak 5 minutes. Using whisk, mash
   soaked bread mixture until uniform paste forms, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk
   in mustard, egg yolk, cayenne, and garlic until smooth, about 15
   seconds. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in vegetable oil in
   steady stream until smooth mayonnaise-like consistency is reached,
   scraping down bowl as necessary. Slowly whisk in 1/2 cup olive oil in
   steady stream until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
5. *For the Croutons:* Cut remaining baguette into 3/4-inch-thick
   slices. Arrange slices in single layer on rimmed baking sheet.
   Drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and season with salt
   and pepper. Bake on lower rack until light golden brown (can be
   toasted while bouillabaisse is in oven), 10 to 15 minutes.
6. Remove bouillabaisse and croutons from oven and set oven to broil.
   Once heated, return bouillabaisse to oven and cook until chicken skin
   is crisp and instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of
   chicken registers 160°F for breasts and 175°F for drumsticks and
   thighs, 5 to 10 minutes (smaller pieces may cook faster than larger
   pieces; remove individual pieces as they reach temperature).
7. Transfer chicken pieces to large plate. Skim excess fat from broth.
   Stir tarragon into broth and season with salt and pepper. Transfer
   broth and potatoes to large shallow serving bowls and top with
   chicken pieces. Drizzle 1 tablespoon rouille over each portion and
   spread 1 teaspoon rouille on each crouton. Serve, floating 2 croutons
   in each bowl and passing remaining croutons and rouille separately.
