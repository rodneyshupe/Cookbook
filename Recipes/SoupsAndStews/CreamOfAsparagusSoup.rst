Ingredients
-----------

-  2 pounds green asparagus
-  1 large onion, chopped
-  3 tablespoons unsalted butter
-  5 cups chicken broth
-  1/2 cup creme fraiche or heavy cream
-  1/4 teaspoon fresh lemon juice, or to taste

Directions
----------

1. Cut tips from 12 asparagus 1 1/2 inches from top and halve tips
   lengthwise if thick. Reserve for garnish. Cut stalks and all
   remaining asparagus into 1/2-inch pieces.

2. Cook onion in 2 tablespoons butter in a 4-quart heavy pot over
   moderately low heat, stirring, until softened. Add asparagus pieces
   and salt and pepper to taste, then cook, stirring, 5 minutes. Add 5
   cups broth and simmer, covered, until asparagus is very tender, 15 to
   20 minutes.

3. While soup simmers, cook reserved asparagus tips in boiling salted
   water until just tender, 3 to 4 minutes, then drain.

4. Puree soup in batches in a blender until smooth, transferring to a
   bowl (use caution when blending hot liquids), and return to pan. Stir
   in creme fraiche, then add more broth to thin soup to desired
   consistency. Season with salt and pepper. Bring soup to a boil and
   whisk in remaining tablespoon butter.

5. Add lemon juice and garnish with asparagus tips.
