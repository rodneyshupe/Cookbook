Ingredients
-----------

-  1/8 ounce dried porcini mushrooms
-  8 sprigs fresh flat leaf parsley plus 3 tablespoons chopped
-  4 sprigs fresh thyme
-  1 bay leaf
-  2 tablespoons unsalted butter
-  1 1/2 pounds leeks, white and light green parts sliced 1/2 inch thick
   and washed thoroughly
-  2 carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
-  2 celery ribs, cut into 1/4-inch pieces
-  1/3 cup dry white wine
-  2 teaspoons soy sauce
-  Salt and pepper
-  6 cups water
-  4 cups low-sodium chicken broth or vegetable broth
-  1/2 cup pearl barley
-  1 garlic clove, peeled and smashed
-  1 1/2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
-  1 turnip, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch pieces
-  1 1/2 cups chopped green cabbage
-  1 cup frozen peas
-  1 teaspoon lemon juice

Directions
----------

1. Grind porcini with spice grinder until they resemble fine meal, 10 to
   30 seconds. Measure out 2 teaspoons porcini powder; reserve remainder
   for other use. Using kitchen twine, tie together parsley sprigs,
   thyme, and bay leaf.
2. Melt butter in large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add leeks, carrots,
   celery, wine, soy sauce, and 2 teaspoons salt. Cook, stirring
   occasionally, until liquid has evaporated and celery is softened,
   about 10 minutes.
3. Add water, broth, barley, porcini powder, herb bundle, and garlic;
   increase heat to high and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low
   and simmer, partially covered, for 25 minutes.
4. Add potatoes, turnip, and cabbage; return to simmer and cook until
   barley, potatoes, turnip, and cabbage are tender, 18 to 20 minutes.
5. Remove pot from heat and remove herb bundle. Stir in peas, lemon
   juice, and chopped parsley; season with salt and pepper to taste.
   Serve, passing Lemon-Thyme Butter separately.
