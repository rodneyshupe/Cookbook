Directions
----------

1. Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and heat the oven to
   325Â°F.
2. Pat the beef dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper.
   Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high
   heat until just smoking. Add half of the meat and cook, stirring
   occasionally, until well browned, 7 to 10 minutes, reducing the heat
   if the pot begins to scorch.
3. Transfer the browned beef to a medium bowl. Repeat with 1 tablespoon
   more oil and the remaining beef; transfer to the bowl.
4. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the pot and place over
   medium-low heat until shimmering. add the onions and 1/4 teaspoon
   salt and cook, stirring often, until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir
   in the garlic and thyme and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
   Stir in the flour and tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, for
   1 minutes. Slowly whisk in the wine, scraping up any browned bits.
   Gradually whisk in the broths until smooth and bring to a simmer.
5. Stir in the browned meat with any accumulated juices and the bay
   leaves and bring to a simmer. Cover, place the pot in the oven, and
   cook for one hour. Stir in the potatoes and carrots and continue to
   cook in the oven, covered, until the meat is tender, 1 to 1 1/2 hours
   longer.
6. Remove the stew from the oven and remove the bay leaves. Stir in the
   peas, cover, and let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in the parsley and
   season with salt and pepper to taste before serving.
