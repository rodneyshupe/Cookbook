Ingredients
-----------

- 1 tablespoon oil
- 1.5 lbs beef stew meat in 1-2 inch cubes
- 2 small-medium onions peeled and cut into slim wedges
- 2 cloves garlic crushed
- 1 pound waxy potatoes peeled and cut into chunks
- 4 medium carrots peeled and cut into chunks
- 3 sticks celery sliced
- 4 cups beef broth see notes if want to use beer
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce can use soy sauce in place
- 4 tablespoons white flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- ground black pepper to taste
- 1 sprig thyme OR 1/4 teaspoon dried
- 1 sprig rosemary OR 1/4 teaspoon dried
- 1 bay leaf skip if you don't have
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch stirred into 3 tablespoon cool water to make a
  slurry (use more cornstarch for an extra-thick gravy, but don’t overdo it
  – it will thicken more as it cools slightly)

Directions
----------

1. Brown meat: Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef and
   brown; remove and add to 4-6 quart slow cooker.
2. Sauté onions: Add onions to hot skillet and sauté over medium heat until
   softened. Pour in about ½ cup of the beef broth, scraping any browned
   bits off the bottom of the pan (see notes for using dark beer in this
   step). Take off the heat and carefully pour into slow cooker over meat.
3. Cook stew: Place potatoes, carrots and celery in slow cooker. Whisk
   together broth, Worcestershire sauce and flour in a measuring jug. Pour
   over meat and vegetables in slow cooker, then carefully stir. Tuck in
   herbs, close lid and cook on LOW for 7-8 hours or on HIGH for 4 hours.
4. Thicken: Open slow cooker and carefully stir. Pour in cornstarch slurry,
   stirring to combine well. Simmer WITHOUT the lid for 15-30 minuets on
   HIGH, until thickened.
