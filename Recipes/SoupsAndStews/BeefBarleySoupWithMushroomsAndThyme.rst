Ingredients
-----------

Rich Beef Broth For Soup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  2 tablespoons vegetable oil
-  6 pounds beef shank meat cut from bone in large chunks, or 4 pounds
   chuck and 2 pounds of small marrow bones
-  1 large onion, halved
-  1/2 cup dry red wine
-  1/2 teaspoon table salt


Soup
^^^^

-  2 tablespoons vegetable oil
-  1 medium onion, cut into medium dice
-  2 medium carrots, cut into medium dice
-  12 ounces domestic mushrooms or wild mushrooms, stems removed, wiped
   clean, and sliced thin
-  1/2 teaspoon dried thyme or 1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme
-  1/2 cup canned tomatoes, cut into medium dice
-  1/2 cup pearl barley
-  1/4 cup minced fresh flat leaf parsley leaves
-  Salt and ground black pepper

Directions
----------

Broth
^^^^^

1. Heat 1 tablepoon oil in a large soup kettle or Dutch oven over
   medium-high heat; brown meat, bones, and onion halves on all sides in
   batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan, and adding the
   additional teaspoon and a half of oil to the pan if necessary. Remove
   and set aside. Add red wine to the empty kettle; cook until reduced
   to a syrup, 1 to 2 minutes. Return browned bones, meat, and onion to
   kettle. Reduce heat to low, then cover and sweat meat and onions
   until they have released about 3/4 cup dark, very intensely flavored
   liquid, about 20 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high, add 2 quarts
   water and salt; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to very low, partially
   cover, and barely simmer until meat is tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
2. Strain broth, discard bones and onions, and set meat aside, reserving
   half of the meat for another use. (At this point broth and meat can
   be cooled to room temperature and covered and refrigerated up to 5
   days.) Let broth stand until fat rises to the top; skim and discard
   fat. When the unreserved meat is cool enough to handle, shred into
   bite-size pieces. Reserve 2 cups shredded meat for soup.


Soup
^^^^

1. Heat oil over medium-high heat in a soup kettle or Dutch oven. Add
   onion and carrots; saute until almost soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add
   mushrooms; saute until softened and liquid almost evaporates, 4 to 5
   minutes longer. Add thyme and tomatoes, then beef broth, meat, and
   barley; bring to simmer. Reduce heat to low; simmer until barley is
   just tender, 45 to 50 minutes. Stir in parsley, adjust seasonings,
   including salt and pepper to taste, and serve.
