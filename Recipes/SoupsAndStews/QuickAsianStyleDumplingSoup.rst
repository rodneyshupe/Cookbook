Instructions
------------

-  4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
-  3 scallions, white and green parts separated, sliced thin on bias
-  2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
-  1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
-  4 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and sliced thin
-  6 cups chicken broth
-  2 (8-ounce) bags frozen Asian-style dumplings or potstickers
-  2 tablespoons fish sauce
-  2 tablespoons lime juice

1. Cook bacon in large saucepan over medium heat until crisp, 6 to 8
   minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towelâ€“lined
   plate. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from pan and return pan to
   medium heat. Add scallion whites, ginger, and pepper flakes and cook
   until scallion whites have softened, about 2 minutes. Add mushrooms
   and cook until beginning to brown, about 5 minutes.
2. Add broth and bring to boil. Add dumplings and simmer over medium-low
   heat until dumplings are cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove
   from heat and stir in fish sauce and lime juice. Serve, sprinkled
   with scallion greens and bacon.
