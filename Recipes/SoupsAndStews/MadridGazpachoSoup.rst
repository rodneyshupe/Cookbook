#. Combine tomato, onion, green pepper, and cucumber chunks. Puree them
   in a blender or food mill until smooth. Transfer the mixture to a large
   bowl or tureen and stir until well blended and smooth. Add tomato
   juice, garlic, cumin, salt, and pepper. Cover and chill.
#. Meanwhile prepare the croutons; in a preheated oven at 375Â°F place the
   bread slices onto a baking sheet and lightly toast. Remove the crusts
   and cut the bread into one-half-inch squares.
#. Clarify the butter by melting it in a saucepan, then separating the
   clear butter from the milky residue. Transfer the clarified butter to
   a skillet and put it over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, add the
   cubes of bread and saute, stirring, until crisp and golden, add chopped
   parsley at the end, stir, and drain on a paper towel.
#. When you are ready to serve, stir in the olive oil and vinegar. Garnish
   with diced vegetables and croutons.
