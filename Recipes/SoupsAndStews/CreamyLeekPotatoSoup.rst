Ingredients
-----------

-  4 medium leeks, white and light-green parts halved lengthwise,
   washed, and sliced thin (about 4 cups), dark green parts halved,
   washed, and cut into 2-inch pieces
-  2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
-  2 cups water
-  4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
-  1 medium onion, chopped medium (about 1 cup)
-  Table salt
-  1 small russet potato (about 6 ounces), peeled, halved lengthwise,
   and cut into 1/4-inch slices
-  1 bay leaf
-  1 (4-inch) sprig fresh thyme or tarragon
-  1 large slice high-quality sandwich bread slice, lightly toasted and
   torn into 1/2-inch pieces (see note)
-  Ground black pepper

Directions
----------

1. Bring dark-green leek pieces, broth, and water to boil in large
   saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 20
   minutes. Strain broth through fine-mesh strainer into medium bowl,
   pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible; set aside.
   Discard solids in strainer and rinse out saucepan.
2. Melt butter in now-empty saucepan over medium-low heat. When butter
   foams, stir in sliced leeks, onion, and 1 teaspoon salt. Reduce heat
   to low and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened,
   about 10 minutes.
3. Increase heat to high, stir in reserved broth, potato, bay leaf, and
   herb sprig and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until
   potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes. Add toasted bread and simmer
   until bread is completely saturated and starts to break down, about 5
   minutes.
4. Remove and discard bay leaf and herb sprig. Transfer half of soup to
   blender and process until smooth and creamy, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer
   to large bowl and repeat with remaining soup. Return soup to saucepan
   and bring to simmer; season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve with
   garnish.
