Ingredients
-----------

-  2 1/2 pounds butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and cut into 2-inch
   chunks (about 7 cups)
-  2 tablespoons unsalted butter
-  1 leek, white and green parts only, quartered lengthwise, sliced
   thin, and washed thoroughly (about 1 1/2 cups)
-  Salt and pepper
-  4 cups vegetable broth
-  1 - 2 cups water
-  2 sprigs fresh thyme
-  1 bay leaf
-  pinch cayenne pepper
-  Sour cream

Directions
----------

1. Place squash in bowl, cover, and microwave until paring knife glides
   easily through flesh, 14 to 18 minutes, stirring halfway through.
   Carefully transfer squash to colander set in bowl (squash will be
   very hot) and drain for 5 minutes; reserve liquid.
2. Melt butter in Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add squash, leek,
   and 1 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring occasionally, until squash pieces
   begin to break down and brown fond forms in bottom of pot, 10 to 13
   minutes.
3. Add 2 cups broth and scrape bottom of pot to loosen and dissolve
   fond. Add remaining 2 cups broth, reserved squash liquid, 1 cup
   water, thyme sprigs, bay leaf, and cayenne. Increase heat to high and
   bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until leeks are
   fully tender, 6 to 7 minutes.
4. Remove and discard bay leaf and thyme sprigs. Working in batches,
   process soup in blender until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Return soup to
   clean pot and bring to simmer, thinning with up to 1 cup water to
   desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper to taste; serve with
   dollop of sour cream. (Soup can be made up to 2 days in advance.)
