Ingredients
-----------

Soup
^^^^

-  4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
-  2 medium shallots, minced (about 4 tablespoons)
-  3 pounds butternut squash (about 1 large), unpeeled, squash halved
   lengthwise, seeds and stringy fibers scraped with spoon and reserved
   (about 1/4 cup), and each half cut into quarters
-  6 cups water
-  Salt
-  1/2 cup heavy cream
-  1 teaspoon dark brown sugar

Cinnamon-Sugar Croutons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  4 slices white sandwich bread, cut into 1/2-inch cubes with crusts
   removed
-  2 tablespoons melted butter
-  4 teaspoons sugar
-  1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions
----------


Soup
^^^^

1. Heat butter in large Dutch oven over medium-low heat until foaming;
   add shallots and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and
   translucent, about 3 minutes. Add squash scrapings and seeds and
   cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and butter turns saffron
   color, about 4 minutes. Add 6 cups water and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt to
   Dutch oven and bring to boil over high heat; reduce heat to
   medium-low, place squash cut-side down in steamer basket, and lower
   basket into pot. Cover and steam until squash is completely tender,
   about 30 minutes. Off heat, use tongs to transfer squash to rimmed
   baking sheet; reserve steaming liquid. When cool enough to handle,
   use large spoon to scrape flesh from skin into medium bowl; discard
   skin.
2. Pour reserved steaming liquid through mesh strainer into second bowl;
   discard solids in strainer. Rinse and dry Dutch oven.
3. In blender, puree squash and reserved liquid in batches, pulsing on
   low until smooth. Transfer puree to Dutch oven; stir in cream and
   brown sugar and heat over medium-low heat until hot. Add salt to
   taste; serve immediately.


Cinnamon-Sugar Croutons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Adjust oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 350Â°F.
   Toss the bread cubes with melted butter in a medium bowl. In a small
   bowl, combine cinnamon and sugar; sprinkle over the bread cubes and
   toss to combine.
2. Spread the bread cubes in a single layer on a parchment-lined baking
   sheet and bake until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes (The croutons can be
   stored in an airtight container for several days.) Sprinkle over soup
   just before serving.
