Ingredients
-----------

-  2 tablespoons unsalted butter
-  2 pounds broccoli, florets roughly chopped into 1-inch pieces, stems trimmed, peeled, and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices
-  1 medium onion, roughly chopped (about 1 cup)
-  2 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)
-  1 1/2 teaspoons dry mustard powder
-  pinch cayenne pepper
-  Table salt
-  3-4 cups water
-  1/4 teaspoon baking soda
-  2 cups low-sodium chicken broth (to make this vegetarian use vegetable broth instead)
-  2 ounces baby spinach (2 loosely packed cups)
-  3 ounces sharp cheddar cheese, shredded (3/4 cup)
-  1 1/2 ounces Parmesan cheese, grated fine (about 3/4 cup), plus extra for serving
-  Ground black pepper

Directions
----------

1. Heat butter in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. When foaming
   subsides, add broccoli, onion, garlic, dry mustard, cayenne, and 1
   teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 6
   minutes. Add 1 cup water and baking soda. Bring to simmer, cover, and
   cook until broccoli is very soft, about 20 minutes, stirring once
   during cooking.
2. Add broth and 2 cups water and increase heat to medium-high. When
   mixture begins to simmer, stir in spinach and cook until wilted,
   about 1 minute. Transfer half of soup to blender, add cheddar and
   Parmesan, and process until smooth, about 1 minute. Transfer soup to
   medium bowl and repeat with remaining soup. Return soup to Dutch
   oven, place over medium heat and bring to simmer. Adjust consistency
   of soup with up to 1 cup water. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
   Serve, passing extra Parmesan separately.
