Broth
^^^^^

- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 4 scallions
- 1 2" piece ginger, peeled, thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 5 cups `Vegetable Broth <#vegetable-broth>`__
- 8 dried shiitake mushrooms
- 1 4x3" piece dried kombu (if not using kombu, replace with an additional 1/2 tablespoon miso)
- 1 tablespoon miso
- 1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce

Ramen
^^^^^

- 4 baby bok choy (about 12 oz. total), quartered lengthwise
- 4 5-oz. packages fresh ramen noodles
- toasted nori sheets, and/or cilantro (for serving; optional)
- 1 cup corn kernels
- `Garlic Chilli Oil <#garlic-chili-oil>`__ or Saracha

Directions
----------

1. Trim dark green parts from scallions and thinly slice; set aside
   for serving. Coarsely chop white and pale green parts. Heat remaining
   2 oil in reserved pot over medium-high. Cook chopped scallions and ginger,
   stirring often, until scallions are charred in spots, about 4 minutes.
   Add tomato paste and cook, stirring occasionally, until it begins to
   stick to the bottom of pot and darkens slightly, about 2 minutes. Add
   mushrooms and kombu, then stir in 5 cups cold water. Bring to a boil,
   then remove from heat and let sit until mushrooms soften, about 10
   minutes. Remove and discard kombu if using.
2. Using a slotted spoon, transfer solids to a blender. Add a ladleful or 2
   of broth to blender and purée until smooth. Stir purée back into broth
   in pot and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Add butter a piece at a
   time, whisking to combine after each addition before adding more. Stir
   in soy sauce; season with salt. Reduce heat to low and keep warm until
   ready to serve.
3. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add bok choy and
   cook until bright green and tender, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon,
   transfer bok choy to a plate. Return water to a boil and cook noodles
   according to package directions. Drain and divide among bowls.
4. To serve, ladle broth over noodles, then top with bok choy and reserved
   garlic oil. Top with nori, cilantro, and corn if desired.
