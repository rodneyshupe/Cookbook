- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 3 carrots, cut into 1 inch pieces

- 1 1/2 cups chicken stock
- 1 (12oz) bottle Guinness (can subtitue another stout or any dark beer)
- 3 sprigs fresh thyme, or 2 teaspoons dried
- 2 bay leaves

Directions
----------

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
2. Heat a heavy pot (that has a tight fitting lid) over medium heat and
   cook bacon until just getting crispy, remove bacon and set aside. Leave
   a couple tablespoons of bacon grease in the pot, and add beef in batches
   (so you don’t overcrowd) until good color develops on  all sides, remove
   from pot and set aside while doing remaining batches.
3. Add carrots and cook a couple minutes, then add in the onion, stir to
   mix then put in the garlic, and when it’s really fragrant add the tomato
   paste. Mix really well and let cook a couple minutes.
4. Sprinkle the flour over the top of everything and mix it in really well
   until everything things looks gross and super dry. Gradually whisk in
   stock scaping brown bits from bottom of the pot. Put in the beer,
   beef, bacon bits, mushrooms and mix well to combine. Add the thyme and
   bay leaves if using, put on the lid and put in the oven for 2 hours.
5. When it’s done, remove the lid, take out the thyme and bay leaves, and
   serve right away or place back into the over (uncovered) and cook
   another 30 minutes to thicken then serve over mash potatoes or use in
   `Steak and Guinness Pie <steak-and-guinness-pie>`__.
