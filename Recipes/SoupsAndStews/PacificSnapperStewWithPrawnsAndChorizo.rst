1. Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add chorizo
   sausage and cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove chorizo
   with a slotted spoon and set aside.
2. Add onion, garlic, leek, and fennel to the pot. Saute for 5-7 minutes, or
   until softened and translucent. Stir in thyme saffron and tomato paste,
   cook for an additional minute to release the flavors.
3. Pour in white wine and cook for a few minutes, scraping up any browned
   bits from the bottom of the pot. Add chicken broth, diced tomatoes, and
   water. Bring to a simmer.
4. Reduce heat to low and add the Pacific snapper pieces. Simmer gently for
   5 minutes.
5. Add the prawns and cook for an additional 3-5 minutes, or until the
   prawns are pink and opaque.
6. Season the stew with salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the reserved
   chorizo and chopped parsley. Serve hot with crusty bread for dipping.
