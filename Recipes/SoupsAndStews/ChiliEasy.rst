  and Shiitake Mushrooms, chopped into bite size pieces and sauteed.  If you
  don't want to use mushrooms try substituing 1/2 cup of bulgur. Replace
  Beef Base with 1 tablespoon soy paste and 1/2oz (14g) dried shiitake
  mushrooms which have been finely chopped into almost a powder. Change
  beans to 14oz can each of Kidney or Black Beans and Cannellini (two cans
