Ingredients
-----------

-  2 pounds shell-on shrimp, preferably Gulf or Mexican Whites
-  3 tablespoons olive oil
-  1/3 cup brandy or cognac, warmed
-  2 tablespoons unsalted butter
-  1 small carrot, chopped fine (about 3 tablespoons)
-  1 small rib celery, chopped fine (about 3 tablespoons)
-  1 small onion, minced (about 6 tablespoons)
-  1 medium clove garlic, minced
-  1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
-  1 1/2 cups dry white wine
-  4 bottles clam juice (8-ounce, 4 cups total)
-  1 can (14 1/2 ounces) diced tomatoes, drained
-  1 sprig fresh tarragon leaves
-  1 cup heavy cream
-  1 tablespoon lemon juice from 1/2 lemon
-  pinch cayenne pepper
-  2 tablespoons dry sherry or Madeira
-  Salt and ground black pepper

Directions
----------

1. Peel 1/2 pound shrimp, reserving shells, and cut each peeled shrimp
   into thirds. With paper towels, thoroughly pat dry remaining shrimp
   and reserved shells.
2. Heat 12-inch heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat until very hot,
   about 3 minutes. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil and swirl to coat
   pan bottom. Add half of shell-on shrimp and half of reserved shells;
   saute until deep pink and shells are lightly browned, about 2
   minutes. Transfer shrimp to medium bowl and repeat with remaining
   oil, shell-on shrimp, and shells. Return first browned batch to
   skillet. Pour warmed brandy over shrimp and wave lit match over pan
   until brandy ignites, shaking pan. When flames subside, transfer
   shrimp and shells to food processor bowl fitted with steel blade and
   process until mixture resembles fine meal, about 10 seconds.
3. Heat butter in large, heavy-bottomed Dutch oven over medium heat
   until foaming. Add carrots, celery, onion, garlic, and ground shrimp;
   cover and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are slightly
   softened and mixture is fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add flour and
   cook, stirring constantly, until combined thoroughly, about 1 minute.
   Stir in wine, clam juice, and tomatoes, scraping pan bottom with
   wooden spoon to loosen browned bits, if any exist. Cover, increase
   heat to medium-high, and bring to boil; then reduce heat to low and
   simmer, stirring frequently, until thickened and flavors meld, about
   20 minutes.
4. Strain bisque through chinois into medium container, pressing on
   solids with back of ladle to extract all liquid. Wash and dry
   now-empty Dutch oven; return strained bisque to Dutch oven and stir
   in tarragon, cream, lemon juice, and cayenne. Bring to simmer over
   medium-high heat; add reserved peeled and cut shrimp and simmer until
   shrimp are firm but tender, about 11/2 minutes. Discard tarragon
   sprig; stir in sherry, season to taste with salt and pepper, and
   serve hot.
