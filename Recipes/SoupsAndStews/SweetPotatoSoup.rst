Ingredients
-----------

-  4 tablespoons unsalted butter
-  1 shallot, sliced thin
-  4 sprigs fresh thyme
-  4 1/4 cups water
-  2 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled, halved lengthwise, and sliced 1/4
   inch thick, 1/4 of peels reserved
-  1 tablespoon packed brown sugar
-  1/2 teaspoon cider vinegar
-  Salt and pepper
-  Minced fresh chives

Directions
----------

1. Melt butter in large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add shallot and
   thyme and cook until shallot is softened but not browned, about 5
   minutes. Add water, increase heat to high, and bring to simmer.
   Remove pot from heat, add sweet potatoes and reserved peels, and let
   stand uncovered for 20 minutes.
2. Add sugar, vinegar, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
   Bring to simmer over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and
   cook until potatoes are very soft, about 10 minutes.
3. Discard thyme sprigs. Working in batches, process soup in blender
   until smooth, 45 to 60 seconds. Return soup to clean pot. Bring to
   simmer over medium heat, adjusting consistency if desired. Season
   with salt and pepper to taste. Serve, topping each portion with
   sprinkle of chives and optionally `Candied Bacon <#candied-bacon>`__
   or `Maple Sour Cream <#maple-sour-cream>`__.

Toppings

skillet over medium heat until crisp and well rendered, 6 to 8 minutes.
Using slotted spoon, remove bacon from skillet and discard fat. Return
bacon to skillet and add 2 teaspoons dark brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon
cider vinegar. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until bacon is
evenly coated. Transfer to plate in single layer. Let bacon cool
completely.
