Channel New England with this rich and warming one-pot clam chowder. If
fresh clams are unavailable (or you're running short on time), substitute
a 10-ounce can of baby clams and 3 cups of bottled clam juice. This is
part of BA's Best, a collection of our essential recipes.

Ingredients
-----------

- 8 pounds cherrystone clams, scrubbed
- 1 tbsp unsalted butter
- 4 ounces bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1 celery stalks, minced
- 1/2 large onion, minced
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1 1/4 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1/2 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 cups heavy cream
- Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
- Chopped fresh chives
- Oyster crackers or Vermont Common Crackers

Directions
----------

1. Bring clams and 2 cups water to a boil in a large pot over high heat.
   Cook until clams just open, 8-10 minutes (discard any that do not open).
   Using a large slotted spoon, transfer clams to a large rimmed baking
   sheet; set broth aside. Let clams cool slightly, then pull meat from
   shells; discard shells.
2. Chop clams into bite-size pieces. Strain broth through a fine-mesh sieve
   set over a large bowl. Add water if needed to measure 3 cups. DO AHEAD:
   Clams and broth can be made 1 day ahead. Cover separately and chill.
3. Melt butter in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add bacon and cook,
   stirring occasionally, until fat is rendered and bacon begins to brown,
   about 8 minutes. Add celery, onion, and garlic and cook, stirring often,
   until onion is translucent, about 10 minutes. Add reserved broth (or 3
   cups bottled clam juice), potatoes, thyme, and bay leaf. Bring chowder
   base to a simmer; cook until potatoes are tender, 20-25 minutes. Stir
   cornstarch and 1 tablespoons water in a small bowl to form a slurry.
   Stir slurry into chowder base; return to a boil to thicken.
4. Remove base from heat. Discard bay leaf. Stir in reserved clams (or two
   10-ounce cans baby clams) and cream. Season with salt, if needed (clams'
   brininess varies), and pepper.
5. Divide chowder among bowls. Garnish with chives and oyster crackers.

DO AHEAD:
   Base can be made 1 day ahead. Let cool; cover and chill. Keep clams
   chilled. Bring base to a simmer before continuing.
