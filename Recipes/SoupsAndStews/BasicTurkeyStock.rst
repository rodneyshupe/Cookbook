+-----------------------+---------------------------+------------------+


Ingredients
-----------

-  1 turkey carcass from 12- to 14-pound turkey, cut into 4 or 5 rough
   pieces to fit into pot
-  1 large onion, peeled and halved
-  1 large carrot, peeled and chopped coarse
-  3 medium cloves garlic, unpeeled and smashed
-  1 large rib celery, about 4 ounces, chopped coarse
-  2 cups dry white wine
-  1 bay leaf
-  5 sprigs fresh flat leaf parsley leaves
-  3 sprigs fresh thyme

Directions
----------

1. Bring turkey carcass, onion, carrot, celery, garlic, wine, bay leaf,
   and 4 1/2 quarts water to boil in 12-quart stockpot over medium-high
   heat, skimming fat or foam that rises to surface. Reduce heat to low
   and simmer, uncovered, 2 hours, continuing to skim surface as
   necessary. Add parsley and thyme; continue to simmer until stock is
   rich and flavorful, about 2 hours longer, continuing to skim surface
   as necessary.
2. Strain stock through large-mesh strainer into large bowl or
   container; remove meat from strained solids, shred into bite-sized
   pieces, and set aside; discard solids in strainer. Cool stock
   slightly, about 20 minutes; spoon fat from surface. Use stock
   immediately or cool to room temperature, cover, and refrigerate up to
   2 days.
