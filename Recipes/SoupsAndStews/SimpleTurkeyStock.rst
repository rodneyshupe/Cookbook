+---------------------------+---------------+


Ingredients
-----------

-  1 carcass from 12- to 14-pound turkey
-  10 cups water

Directions
----------

1. Using chefâ€™s knife, remove wings from carcass and separate each wing
   at joints into 3 pieces. Cut through ribs to separate breastbone from
   backbone, then cut backbone into 3 to 4 pieces. Using kitchen shears
   or heavy knife, remove ribs from both sides of breastbone. (You
   should have roughly 4 pounds of bones broken into 10 to 12 pieces.)
2. Arrange bones in stockpot or large Dutch oven in compact layer. Add
   water and bring to boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low,
   cover, and cook for 2 hours, using shallow spoon to skim foam and
   impurities from surface as needed.
3. Strain stock through fine-mesh strainer into large container; discard
   solids. Let stock cool slightly, about 20 minutes. Skim any fat from
   surface (reserve fat for making soup). Let stock cool for 1 1/2 hours
   before refrigerating.

Storage
-------

Stock can be refrigerated for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 4 months.

Freezing stock in portions of different sizes makes it easy to defrost
it for different applications. Stock can be frozen for up to four
months. \* **Ice Cube Tray:** After the cubes have frozen, transfer them
to a zipper-lock bag. Use the 2-tablespoon portions for pan sauces or
stir-fry sauces. \* **Muffin Tin:** Once frozen, transfer the 1-cup
portions to a zipper-lock bag. Use them for rice, risotto, grains,
couscous, or casseroles or as a braising liquid. \* **Zipper-Lock Bag:**
Line a 4-cup measuring cup with a zipper-lock bag; pour in the cooled
stock. Lay the bag flat to freeze. Use for soups, stews, or gravy.
