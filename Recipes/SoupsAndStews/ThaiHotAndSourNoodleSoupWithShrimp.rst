Directions
----------

1. Bring 4 quarts water to boil in large pot. Remove from heat, add vermicelli,
   and let sit, stir- ring occasionally, until vermicelli are fully tender,
   10 to 15 minutes. Drain, rinse with cold water, drain again, and distribute
   evenly among large soup bowls.
2. Place lemon grass, scallion whites, lime leaves, whole Thai chile, and
   galangal on cutting board and lightly smash with meat pounder or bottom of
   small skillet until mixture is moist and very fragrant. Transfer lemon
   grass mixture to Dutch oven. Add broth and sugar and bring to boil over
   high heat. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Using slotted spoon,
   remove solids from pot and discard.
3. Add mushrooms, fish sauce, scallion greens, and sliced Thai chile and
   simmer for 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in shrimp. Cover and let sit off heat until
   shrimp are opaque and cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and
   lime juice. Season with extra sugar, extra fish sauce, and extra lime juice
   to taste.
4. Ladle soup into bowls of noodles; sprinkle with cilantro and Thai basil, if
   using. Serve, drizzled with Thai Chile Jam, if using, and passing lime
   wedges and extra sliced Thai chiles, if using, separately.
