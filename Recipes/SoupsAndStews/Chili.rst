-  2 teaspoons, ground cumin
-  2 teaspoons, unsweetened cocoa powder
-  2 1/2 cups, chicken broth (divided use)
-  2 medium onions - cut into 3/4-inch pieces (about 2 cups)
-  3 small jalapeno chiles - stems and seeds removed and discarded,
   flesh cut into 1/2-inch pieces
-  3 tablespoons, vegetable oil
-  4 medium garlic cloves - minced or pressed through garlic press
   (about 4 teaspoons)
-  1 (14.5 ounce) can, diced tomatoes
-  2 teaspoons, light molasses
-  3 1/2 pounds, blade steak, 3/4 inch thick - trimmed of gristle and
   fat and cut into 3/4-inch pieces
-  1 (12-ounce) bottle, mild lager beer (such as Budweiser)

Directions
----------

1. In a large Dutch oven, combine 4 tablespoons of salt, 4 quarts of
   water, and the beans and bring to boil over high heat. Remove the pot
   from heat, cover, and allow the beans to stand for 1 hour. Drain and
   rinse the beans well.
2. Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and pre-heat the
   oven to 300°F.
3. Place the ancho chiles in 12-inch skillet set over medium-high heat;
   toast them,stirring frequently, until flesh is fragrant, 4 to 6
   minutes - reducing the heat if chiles begin to smoke. Transfer the
   toasted chiles to the bowl of food processor and allow them to cool.
   Do not wash out the skillet.
4. To the food processor containing the toasted ancho chiles, add the
   àrbol chiles,cornmeal, oregano, cumin, cocoa, and 3/4 teaspoon salt.
   Process until finely ground - about 2 minutes. With the processor
   running, very slowly add 1/2 cup of the broth through the feed tube,
   until a smooth paste forms - about 45 seconds,scraping down the sides
   of the bowl as necessary. Transfer the paste to a small bowl and set
   aside. Place the onions in the now-empty processor bowl and pulse
   until roughly chopped - about four 1-second pulses. Add the jalapenos
   and pulse until the mixture has the consistency of chunky salsa -
   about four 1-second pulses - scraping down the bowl as necessary.
5. In a large Dutch oven, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat.
   Add the onion mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until moisture
   has evaporated and vegetables are softened - 7 to 9 minutes. Add the
   garlic and cook until fragrant -about 1 minute. Add the reserved
   chili paste, the tomatoes, and the molasses. Stir until the chili
   paste is thoroughly combined with the other ingredients. Add the
   remaining 2 cups broth and the drained beans; bring to a boil, then
   reduce the heat to simmer.
6. Meanwhile, in the 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1
   tablespoon oil until it is shimmering. Pat the pieces of beef dry
   with paper towels and sprinkle them with 11/2 teaspoons of salt.
7. To the skillet, add half of the beef and cook until browned on all
   sides - about10 minutes. Transfer the meat to the Dutch oven. Add 1/2
   of the bottle of lager to the skillet, scraping bottom of pan to
   loosen any browned bits, and bring to a simmer. Transfer the lager to
   the Dutch oven. Repeat with the remaining tablespoon oil, beef
   pieces, and lager. (Heat the oil, brown the beef, transfer the beef
   to the Dutch oven, add lager to the skillet, bring it to a simmer,
   and add the simmering beer to the Dutch oven.) Once the last addition
   of lager has been added to the Dutch oven, stir to combine the
   ingredients and return the mixture to a simmer.
8. Cover the pot and transfer to the preheated oven. Cook until the meat
   and beans are fully tender - 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Allow the chili to
   stand uncovered for 10minutes. Stir well and season to taste with
   salt before serving.


Notes
-----

-  A 4-pound chuck-eye roast, well trimmed of fat, can be substituted
   for the steak.
-  Because much of the chili flavor is held in the fat of this dish,
   refrain from skimming fat from the surface.
-  Wear gloves when working with both dried and fresh chiles.
-  Dried New Mexican or guajillo chiles make a good substitute for the
   anchos; each dried arbol may be substituted with 1/8 teaspoon
   cayenne. If you prefer not to work with any whole dried chiles, the
   anchos and àrbols can be replaced with 1/2 cup commercial chili
   powder and 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, though the texture of
   the chili will be slightly compromised.
-  Good choices for condiments include diced avocado, chopped red onion,
   chopped cilantro leaves, lime wedges, sour cream, and shredded
   Monterey Jack or cheddar cheese.
-  The chili can be made up to 3 days in advance.
