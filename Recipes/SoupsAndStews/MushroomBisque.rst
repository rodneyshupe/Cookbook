Ingredients
-----------

-  1 pound white mushrooms, trimmed
-  8 ounces cremini mushrooms, trimmed
-  8 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stemmed
-  Kosher salt and pepper
-  2 tablespoons vegetable oil
-  1 small onion, chopped fine
-  1 sprig fresh thyme, tied with kitchen twine
-  2 tablespoons dry sherry
-  4 cups water
-  3 1/2 cups chicken broth
-  2/3 cup heavy cream, plus extra for serving
-  2 large egg yolks
-  1 teaspoon lemon juice
-  Chopped fresh chives

Directions
----------

1. Toss white mushrooms, cremini mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms, and 1
   tablespoon salt together in large bowl. Cover with large plate and
   microwave, stirring every 4 minutes, until mushrooms have released
   their liquid and reduced to about one-third their original volume,
   about 12 minutes. Transfer mushrooms to colander set in second large
   bowl and drain well. Reserve liquid.
2. Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add
   mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are
   browned and fond has formed on bottom of pot, about 8 minutes. Add
   onion, thyme sprig, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring
   occasionally, until onion is just softened, about 2 minutes. Add
   sherry and cook until evaporated. Stir in reserved mushroom liquid
   and cook, scraping up any browned bits. Stir in water and broth and
   bring to simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes.
3. Discard thyme sprig. Working in batches, process soup in blender
   until very smooth, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per batch. Return soup to
   now-empty pot. (Soup can be refrigerated for up to 2 days. Warm to
   150°F before proceeding with recipe.)
4. Whisk cream and egg yolks together in medium bowl. Stirring slowly
   and constantly, add 2 cups soup to cream mixture. Stirring
   constantly, slowly pour cream mixture into simmering soup. Heat
   gently, stirring constantly, until soup registers 165°F (do not
   overheat). Stir in lemon juice and season with salt and pepper to
   taste. Serve immediately, garnishing each serving with 1 teaspoon
   extra cream and sprinkle of chives.
