Ingredients
-----------

-  8 cups frozen corn kernels (about 2 pounds), thawed (see note)
-  3 cups low-sodium chicken broth
-  6 slices bacon, chopped fine
-  1 onion, chopped fine
-  2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch chunks
-  1/2 cup heavy cream
-  1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme
-  1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
-  Salt and pepper

Directions
----------

1. Puree 4 cups corn and 2 cups broth in blender or food processor until
   smooth. Cook bacon in large pot over medium-high heat until crisp,
   about 5 minutes; transfer to paper towel-lined plate. Reduce heat to
   medium and cook onion and potatoes in bacon fat until onion is
   softened, about 5 minutes.
2. Whisk in pureed corn mixture, cream, thyme, cayenne, and remaining
   broth and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in
   remaining corn and cook until corn is heated through, about 2
   minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with crisp bacon.
   Serve.


Notes
-----

Frozen corn can be quickly defrosted in a bowl in the microwave. If
using fresh corn, you’ll need about 1 dozen medium ears; use a chef’s
knife to cut the kernels off the husked and silked ears.
