Vegan Chickpea Noodle Soup
==========================

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 onion, chopped fine
- 3 carrots, peeled and sliced ¼ inch thick
- 2 celery ribs, sliced ¼ inch thick
- Salt and pepper
- 3 tablespoons nutritional yeast
- 2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme or ¾ teaspoon dried
- 2 bay leaves
- 6 cups vegetable broth
- 2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, rinsed
- 2 ounces (1/2 cup) ditalini pasta
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley

Directions
----------

1. Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion,
   carrots, celery, and ¼ teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring occasionally,
   until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in nutritional yeast, thyme, and
   bay leaves and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
2. Stir in broth and chickpeas and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low
   and simmer, partially covered, until flavors meld, about 10 minutes.
3. Stir in pasta, increase heat to medium-high, and boil until just tender,
   about 10 minutes. Off heat, discard bay leaves and stir in parsley.
   Season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve.
