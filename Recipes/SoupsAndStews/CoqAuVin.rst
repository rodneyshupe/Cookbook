Ingredients
-----------

-  1 bottle fruity, smooth, medium-bodied red wine (see note below)
-  2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
-  10 sprigs fresh flat leaf parsley leaves
-  2 tablespoons minced fresh flat leaf parsley leaves
-  2 sprigs fresh thyme
-  1 bay leaf
-  4 ounces bacon, preferably thick-cut, cut crosswise into 1/4-inch
   pieces
-  2 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed of excess fat
   and cut in half crosswise
-  Salt and ground black pepper
-  5 tablespoons unsalted butter
-  24°Frozen pearl onions, thawed, drained, and patted dry (about 1
   cup)\ *(see note below)*
-  8 ounces cremini mushrooms, wiped clean, stems trimmed, quartered
   *(halved if small)*
-  2 medium cloves garlic, minced or pressed through garlic press (about
   2 teaspoons)
-  1 tablespoon tomato paste
-  2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

Directions
----------

1. Bring all but 1 tablespoon wine (reserve for later use), broth,
   parsley sprigs, thyme, and bay to simmer in large saucepan over
   medium-high heat. Cook until reduced to 3 cups, about 25 minutes.
   Discard herbs.
2. Meanwhile, cook bacon in large Dutch oven over medium heat until
   browned, 7 to 8 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to
   paper-towel-lined plate. Reserve 2 tablespoons fat in small bowl;
   discard remaining fat.
3. Lightly season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon
   reserved bacon fat in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just
   smoking. Add half of chicken in single layer and cook until lightly
   browned, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to plate and repeat with
   remaining chicken and 1 tablespoon bacon fat.
4. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in now-empty Dutch oven over medium-high
   heat. When foaming subsides, add pearl onions and mushrooms; cook,
   stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Reduce
   heat to medium, add garlic, and cook until fragrant, about 30
   seconds. Add tomato paste and flour; cook, stirring frequently, until
   well combined, about 1 minute.
5. Add reduced wine mixture, scraping bottom of pot with wooden spoon to
   loosen browned bits; add 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Return chicken, any
   accumulated juices, and reserved bacon to pot; increase heat to high
   and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover pot, and simmer
   until chicken is tender, about 25 minutes, stirring halfway through
   cooking time.
6. Using slotted spoon, transfer chicken to large bowl; tent with foil
   to keep warm. Increase heat to medium-high and simmer sauce until
   thick and glossy and measures 3 cups, about 5 minutes. Off heat, stir
   in remaining 2 tablespoons butter and reserved 1 tablespoon wine.
   Season to taste with salt. Return chicken to pot and top with minced
   parsley. Serve immediately with egg noodles or mashed potatoes.


Notes
-----

A medium-bodied, fruity red wine such as Pinot Noir or Rhône Valley
Grenache is best for this recipe. Avoid bold, heavily oaked red wine s
like Cabernet and light-bodied wines like Beaujolais.

To use fresh pearl onions, trim the root and stem end of each onion and
discard. Boil for 1 minute, shock in ice water, then peel a thin strip
from root to stem. Remove any remaining outer skin (it’s like peeling
off a jacket). If neither frozen nor fresh pearl onions are available,
substitute one large onion cut into 1/2-inch pieces. (Do not use jarred
pearl onions, which will turn mushy and disintegrate into the sauce.)
