This wonderful comfort soup is a balance of lemon, salt, heat, and savory
herbs. Serve it on a cold day. Can be made vegan, vegetarian, or with
chicken easily.

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 large yellow onion, diced
- 1 stalks celery with leaves, diced
- 1 carrots, diced
- 3/4 teaspoons minced garlic
- 3 cups water
- 1 cups French green lentils
- 1 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 1/2 tablespoon salt, or more to taste
- 1/2 tablespoon ground coriander
- 1/2 tablespoon ground cumin
- 3/4 teaspoons ground black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 lemon, cut into wedges
- 1 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- freshly ground black pepper

Directions
----------

1. Heat olive oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Cook and
   stir onion, celery, and carrots until slightly tender, about 5 minutes.
   Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add water,
   lentils, 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, salt, coriander, cumin, black
   pepper, and cayenne pepper; stir to incorporate. Cover and simmer until
   lentils are tender, stirring occasionally, 1 1/2 hours.
2. Whisk butter and flour together in a small saucepan over medium-low
   heat; stir constantly until thickened and paste-like, about 10 minutes.
   Reduce heat to low, stirring every 2 to 3 minutes, until light brown,
   about 20 more minutes. Whisk flour paste into finished soup, a spoonful
   at a time, until smooth and creamy. Serve with lemon wedges, 2
   tablespoons parsley, and a sprinkle of freshly ground pepper.
