Instructions
------------

-  8 cups low-sodium chicken broth
-  1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
-  2 garlic cloves, minced
-  2 tablespoons fish sauce
-  1/2 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
-  4 packages instant noodles, broken into large pieces
-  1 small flank steak (about 1 pound), cut lengthwise into thirds and
   cut crosswise into 1/4-inch slices
-  1/2 head medium Napa cabbage, sliced thin crosswise (about 4 cups)
-  1/4 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro leaves

Directions
----------

1. Bring broth, ginger, garlic, fish sauce, and five-spice powder to
   boil in Dutch oven. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until
   flavors meld, about 10 minutes.
2. Add noodles to simmering broth and cook, stirring occasionally, until
   nearly tender, about 2 minutes. Stir in beef and cabbage and simmer
   until cabbage is wilted and beef is cooked through, about 2 minutes.
   Add cilantro. Serve.
