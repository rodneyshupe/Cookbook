-  6 large shallots, minced (about 3/4 cup)
-  2 small cloves garlic, minced (about 1 1/2 teaspoons)
-  1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg, freshly grated
-  2 pounds white button mushrooms, wiped clean and sliced 1/4 inch
   thick
-  3 1/2 cups chicken stock or canned low-sodium chicken broth
-  4 cups hot water
-  1/2 ounce dried porcini mushrooms, rinsed well
-  1/3 cup dry sherry or Madeira
-  1 cup heavy cream
-  2 teaspoons lemon juice from 1 lemon
-  Salt and ground black pepper

Sauteed Wild Mushroom Garnish (optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  2 tablespoons unsalted butter
-  8 ounces shiitake mushrooms or chanterelle, oyster, or cremini
   mushrooms, stems trimmed and discarded, mushrooms wiped clean and
   sliced thin

Directions
----------

1. Melt butter in large, heavy-bottomed Dutch oven over medium-low heat;
   when foaming subsides, add shallots and saute, stirring frequently,
   until softened, about 4 minutes. Stir in garlic and nutmeg; cook
   until fragrant, about 1 minute longer. Increase heat to medium; add
   sliced mushrooms and stir to coat with butter. Cook, stirring
   occasionally, until mushrooms release liquid, about 7 minutes. Reduce
   heat to medium-low, cover pot, and cook, stirring occasionally, until
   softened and mushrooms have released all liquid, about 20 minutes.
   Add chicken stock, water, and porcini mushrooms; cover and bring to
   simmer, then reduce heat to low and simmer until mushrooms are fully
   tender, about 20 minutes longer.
2. Pour soup into a large bowl. Rinse and dry Dutch oven. Puree soup in
   batches in blender until smooth, filling blender jar only halfway for
   each batch. Return soup to Dutch oven; stir in Madeira and cream and
   bring to simmer over low heat. Add lemon juice, season to taste with
   salt and pepper, and serve with sauteed mushroom garnish, if desired.
   (Can be cooled to room temperature and refrigerated up to 4 days.) If
   making ahead, add cream at serving time.
3. *For the Sauteed Wild Mushroom Garnish (optional)*: Heat butter in
   medium skillet over low heat; when foam subsides, add mushrooms and
   sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally,
   until mushrooms release their liquid, about 10 minutes for shiitakes
   and chanterelles, about 5 minutes for oysters, and about 9 minutes
   for cremini. Uncover and continue to cook, stirring occasionally,
   until liquid released by mushrooms has evaporated and mushrooms are
   browned, about 2 minutes for shiitakes, about 3 minutes for
   chanterelles, and about 2 minutes for oysters and cremini. Sprinkle a
   portion of mushrooms over individual bowls of soup and serve.
