French Onion Soup
=================

For the best flavor, make the soup a day or 2 in advance. Alternatively,
the onions can be prepared through step 1, cooled in the pot, and
refrigerated for up to 3 days before proceeding with the recipe.

Ingredients
-----------

-  3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 3 pieces
-  6 large yellow onions (about 4 pounds), halved and cut pole to pole
   into 1/4-inch-thick slices
-  Table salt
-  2 cups water, plus extra for deglazing
-  1/2 cup dry sherry
-  4 cups low-sodium chicken broth (see note)
-  2 cups beef broth (see note)
-  6 sprigs fresh thyme, tied with kitchen twine
-  1 bay leaf
-  Ground black pepper
-  1 small baguette, cut into 1/2-inch slices
-  8 ounces shredded Gruyere cheese (about 2 1/2 cups)

Directions
----------

1. For the soup: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven
   to 400°F. Generously spray inside of heavy-bottomed large (at least
   7-quart) Dutch oven with nonstick cooking spray. Place butter in pot
   and add onions and 1 teaspoon salt. Cook, covered, 1 hour (onions
   will be moist and slightly reduced in volume). Remove pot from oven
   and stir onions, scraping bottom and sides of pot. Return pot to oven
   with lid slightly ajar and continue to cook until onions are very
   soft and golden brown, 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours longer, stirring onions
   and scraping bottom and sides of pot after 1 hour.
2. Carefully remove pot from oven and place over medium-high heat. Using
   oven mitts to handle pot, cook onions, stirring frequently and
   scraping bottom and sides of pot, until liquid evaporates and onions
   brown, 15 to 20 minutes, reducing heat to medium if onions are
   browning too quickly. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, until
   pot bottom is coated with dark crust, 6 to 8 minutes, adjusting heat
   as necessary. (Scrape any fond that collects on spoon back into
   onions.) Stir in 1/4 cup water, scraping pot bottom to loosen crust,
   and cook until water evaporates and pot bottom has formed another
   dark crust, 6 to 8 minutes. Repeat process of deglazing 2 or 3 more
   times, until onions are very dark brown. Stir in sherry and cook,
   stirring frequently, until sherry evaporates, about 5 minutes.
3. Stir in broths, 2 cups water, thyme, bay leaf, and 1/2 teaspoon salt,
   scraping up any final bits of browned crust on bottom and sides of
   pot. Increase heat to high and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to low,
   cover, and simmer 30 minutes. Remove and discard herbs, then season
   with salt and pepper.
4. For the croutons: While soup simmers, arrange baguette slices in
   single layer on baking sheet and bake in 400°F oven until bread is
   dry, crisp, and golden at edges, about 10 minutes. Set aside.
5. To serve: Adjust oven rack 6 inches from broiler element and heat
   broiler. Set individual broiler-safe crocks on baking sheet and fill
   each with about 1 3/4 cups soup. Top each bowl with 1 or 2 baguette
   slices (do not overlap slices) and sprinkle evenly with Gruyere.
   Broil until cheese is melted and bubbly around edges, 3 to 5 minutes.
   Let cool 5 minutes before serving.


Notes
-----

To speed up the process you can use this short cut for step #1. Combine
onions and 1 teaspoon salt in large microwave-safe bowl and cover with
large microwave-safe plate (plate should completely cover bowl and not
rest on onions). Microwave on high power for 20 to 25 minutes until
onions are soft and wilted, stirring halfway through cooking. (Use oven
mitts to remove bowl from microwave and remove plate away from you to
avoid steam burn.) Drain onions (about 1/2 cup liquid should drain off).
Place Dutch oven over medium-high heat and melt butter before adding
wilted onions. Proceed with step #2. The soup’s flavor, however, will
not be quite as deep as with the stove-top method. If you don’t have a
microwave-safe bowl large enough to accommodate all of the onions, cook
in a smaller bowl in 2 batches.

If using ordinary soup bowls, sprinkle the toasted bread slices with
Gruyere and return them to the broiler until the cheese melts, then
float them on top of the soup.
