+-----------------------+--------------------------+-------------------+

Ingredients
-----------

-  1 (12-inch) baguette, sliced 1 inch thick on bias
-  1 garlic clove, peeled
-  2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
-  4 tablespoons unsalted butter
-  8 ounces kielbasa sausage, halved lengthwise and sliced 1/2 inch
   thick
-  2 pounds leeks
-  5 cups chicken broth
-  1/2 pound red potatoes, unpeeled, cut into 3/4-inch pieces
-  Salt and pepper

Directions
----------

1. Prep leeks, trim and discard root and dark leaves. Slice trimmed leek
   in half lengthwise. Slice halves into 1 inch pieces as directed.
   Rinse cut leeks thoroughly to remove dirt and sand.
2. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400Â°F. Arrange
   bread in single layer in rimmed baking sheet and bake until dry and
   crisp, about 10 minutes, turning slices over halfway through baking.
   While still hot, rub each slice of bread with garlic and drizzle with
   oil; set aside.
3. Meanwhile, melt butter in Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook kielbasa
   until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in leeks, cover, and
   cook, stirring occasionally, until leeks are tender but not mushy, 10
   to 15 minutes.
4. Stir in broth, scraping up any browned bits. Stir in potatoes and
   bring to simmer. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer gently
   until potatoes are almost tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
5. Off heat, let sit until potatoes are tender and flavors meld, 10 to
   15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve with
   garlic toast.
