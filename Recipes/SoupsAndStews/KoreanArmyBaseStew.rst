The best and the most popular Korean hot pot dish – Budae Jjigae (Army base stew)
It is loaded with Kimchi, spam, sausages, ramen noodles and much more.  This is
just one set of ingredients but you can experiment.

Ingredients
-----------

Sauce
^^^^^
- 1 tablespoon Gochugaru (Korean chili flakes)
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon maggi sauce (substitute 1/2 tablespoon each of soy sauce and worcestershire)
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 1 tablespoon Gochujang (hot pepper paste)
- Few sprinkles ground black pepper

Stew
^^^^
- 200 g SPAM (thinly sliced)
- 2 hot dogs (150g) thinly and diagonally sliced)
- 250 g tofu, sliced (about 1.5cm, 1/2 inch thickness) (optional)
- 200 g enoki mushrooms (base stem removed &amp; stems separated,)
- 200 g king oyster mushrooms (thinly sliced lengthways)
- 100 g shiitake mushroom caps (thinly sliced)
- 1/2 cup Kimchi (ripened bite-sized)
- 1/2 cup baked beans
- 110 g instant ramen noodles
- 50 g Korean rice cakes for soup (soaked in cold water for 15 mins if it was frozen)
- 4 cups stock (see note)
- 30 g green onion (thinly &amp; diagonally sliced)
- 1 to 2 american cheese slice

Directions
----------

1. Combine sauce ingredients in a small bowl, stir till fully combined.
2. Assemble the main ingredients (except for instant ramen noodles, rice
   cakes, green onion and cheese) in a shallow pot. Add the sauce in the
   middle. Pour the stock into the corner of the pot. Close the lid and boil
   it on medium high heat until the stock starts to boil (about 8 mins).
3. Add the remaining ingredients – instant ramen noodles, rice cakes, green
   onion and cheese on top of the pot and boil uncovered until the noodles
   are cooked (about 2 to 3 mins). Reduce the heat to low (if you're
   cooking on a portable burner and sharing the food at the dinning table).
4. Start dishing out soup, protein and vegetables onto your own soup bowl.
   Serve with steamed rice (and with other Korean side dishes).

Note
----

For the stock, you can use water or bone broth or even chicken stock.  I use
1 cup chicken stock, 1 cup beef stock and 2 cups of water and that works well.
You can also use Korean Dashi (dried kelp & anchovy stock)
