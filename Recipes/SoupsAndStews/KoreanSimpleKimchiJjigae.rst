| Total: 30 minutes | Yield: 3-4 servings |
+-------------------+---------------------+

Ingredients
-----------

- 8 oz. pork chop with bone
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon vegtable oil
- 4-6 green onions, greens cut into 1/2 in pieces, whites chopped thin
- 1 cup chopped Napa cabbage kimchi with juices
- 1 Tbsp. gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)
- 2-3 cups water
- 8 oz. firm tofu, cut into 1" pieces
- Cooked rice (for serving)

Directions
----------

1. Remove bone from pork chop and dice meat into bite size pieces, about
   1/2 inch.  Heat oil in a medium size pot over medium-high heat. Season
   meat with salt and pepper, then add meat and bone to the pot and spread
   the meat out so all is in contact with the pots surface.  Cook,
   undisturbed, until meat starts to brown, about 3-4 minutes.
2. Turn meat over to brown other sides. At this point, add white part of
   green onion and cook for until most of the pink has left the meat.
3. Add Kimchi along with liquid and the gochujang.  Deglaze bottom of the
   pan with a few tablespoons of water before adding the rest of the water.
   Bring to a boil and then simmer for 15-20 minutes.
4. Add green parts of the green onion to the top of the soup and serve with
   rice.
