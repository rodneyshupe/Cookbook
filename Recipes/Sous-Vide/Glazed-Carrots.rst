==============

You’ll never eat a more carrot-y carrot.

+-----------------------+--------------------+---------------+------------+
| Prep Time: 10 minutes | Total Time: 1 hour | Servings: 4-6 | Temp 183°F |
+-----------------------+--------------------+---------------+------------+


Ingredients
-----------

-  1 pound baby whole baby carrots, peeled or well-scrubbed, or 1 pound
   medium to large carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
-  2 tablespoons (30g) unsalted butter
-  1 tablespoon (12g) granulated sugar
-  Kosher salt
-  Freshly ground black pepper
-  1 tablespoon (15ml) chopped flat leaf parsley (optional)


Directions
----------

1. Preheat sous-vide cooker to 183°F. Place carrots, butter, sugar, and
   1/2 teaspoon kosher salt in a vacuum bag and seal according to
   manufacturer’s instructions. Cook carrots in the water bath until
   fully tender, about 1 hour. At this point, carrots can be stored in
   refrigerator for up to 1 week.
2. empty entire contents of bag into a 12-inch, heavy-bottomed skillet
   and cook over high heat, stirring constantly, until liquid has
   reduced to a shiny glaze, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt
   and pepper, stir in parsley, and serve. If glaze breaks and turns
   greasy, add water a teaspoon at a time, shaking pan to re-form glaze.


Make Ahead
----------

After step 1 quick chill the pouch, submerged in ice water (half
ice/half water) for 15 to 20 minutes and refrigerate up to 1 week. To
server reheat in water bath with protein and continue with Step 2.


Variations
----------

The following vegetables will do equally well with the exact same
recipe: \* Small onions (like cipollini or pearl onions), peeled. \*
Small radishes, scrubbed of dirt, stems trimmed to 1/4-inch, or large
radishes, cut into 1-inch pieces. \* Small turnips, peeled, stems
trimmed to 1/4-inch, or large turnips, cut into 1-inch pieces. \*
Parsnips, peeled, and cut into 1-inch pieces. \* Baby artichokes,
trimmed and quartered.

Why this works
--------------

-  at 183°F, carrots will soften but not turn mushy.
-  Cooking carrots sous-vide cooks them in their own juices, packing
   them with intense carrot flavor.
-  Tossing the carrots in the skillet for a couple minutes after cooking
   glazes them in their reduced juices, enhancing their flavor and
   appearance


Make Ahead
----------

Quick chill the pouch, submerged in ice water (half ice/half water) for
15 to 20 minutes and refrigerate until ready to reheat alongside meat or
fish in the water oven.
