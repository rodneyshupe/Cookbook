-----------

- Finely grated zest of 2 lemons
- 6 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 6 tablespoons cup sugar

1. In a saucepan, combine the lemon zest, juice, and 2 tablespoons of the sugar.

2. In another saucepan, combine the cream, 2 tablespoons of the sugar, the
   vanilla seeds and pod, and bring to just below boiling.

   sugar until smooth.
4. Slowly whisk the hot cream into the yolks; stir in the lemon syrup and
   strain through a fine sieve.

6. Skim any foam from the surface and divide the mixture among 6 sealable 4oz
   Mason jars. Cook sous vide for 1 hour
