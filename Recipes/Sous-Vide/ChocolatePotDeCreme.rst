Yield: 6 servings

Ingredients
-----------
- 2 1/2  cups (625 mL) whipping 35% cream
- 5 ounces (140g) bittersweet or semisweet chocolate
- 8 large egg yolks
- 1/3 cup (75 mL) sugar

Directions
----------

1. Chop the chocolate into smallish pieces so it will melt quickly.
2. Bring cream up to 160ºF over medium heat.
   Remove from heat and add chocolate, whisking until melted and smooth.
3. Whisk together yolks and sugar.
   Carefully whisk the hot cream / chocolate mixture into the eggs.
4. Strain to remove any lumps. Allow to rest at room temp 20 minutes, so
   that any bubbles in the mixture can rise to the top.
5. Heat sous vide water bath to 175ºF / 80ºC.  Skim away any remaining
   bubbles. Divide mixture among 6 sealable 4oz jars. Place jars into the
   sous vide bath and cook for one hour.
6. Remove the jars and place in an ice bath to chill.
