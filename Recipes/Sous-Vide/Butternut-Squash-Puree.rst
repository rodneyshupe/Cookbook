Ingredients
-----------

- 2 pounds butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and sliced ¼ inch thick
- ¼ cup water, plus extra as needed
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- Salt

Directions
----------

1. Set your sous-vide to 200°F (93°C)
2. Place squash, water, butter, and ½ teaspoon salt in 1-gallon zipper-lock
   freezer bag. Seal bag, pressing out as much air as possible. Place bag in
   second 1-gallon zipper-lock freezer bag and seal. Gently lower bag into
   prepared water bath, weight bag until squash is fully submerged, and clip
   top corner of bag to side of water bath container, allowing remaining
   air bubbles to rise to top of bag. Reopen 1 corner of zipper, release
   remaining air bubbles, and reseal bag. Cover and cook for
   1 hour to 1½ hours.
3. Transfer squash and cooking liquid to blender and process until smooth,
   about 2 minutes, scraping down sides of blender jar as needed. (If mixture
   is not blending easily, adjust consistency of puree with up to 2 tablespoons
   extra water.) Season with salt to taste. Serve.


Note:
-----

-  Be sure to double bag the squash to protect against seam failure. Squash
   has a tendency to float when placed in a sous vide water bath, which can
   lead to uneven cooking. Use weights to make sure the squash is fully
   immersed during cooking..
