+----------------------+----------------+---------------+-------------+

Ingredients
-----------
**Beef**
- 1 eye of Round Roast 1-2 pounds
- 2 tbsp kosher salt
- 2 tsp fresh ground black pepper
- 1 tsp smoker paprika
- 1 tsp onion powder
- 1 tsp garlic powder

**Horseradish Sauce**
- 1 cup sour cream
- 1 1/2 teaspoon prepared horseradish
- 2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper

**Au Jus**
- 1 tsp Onion Powder
- 3 cups beef broth
- 1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce, plus more to taste
- 1 1/2 teaspoons dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon sherry
- 1/8 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
- Freshly cracked black pepper


Directions
----------

1. Preheat Sous-Vide to 140°F
2. Season beef thoroughly with the salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder,
   onion powder, and seal in vacuum seal bag using the vacuum sealer.
   Let cook for at least 18 hours.
3. While roast is cooking, prepare Horseradish Sauce. Combine the sour
   cream, horseradish, salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Cover and
   refrigerate to develop the flavors.
4. Place cast iron skillet over high heat. Carefully remove the roast
   from the water bath. When skillet is smoking, cut open the bag and
   place the roast in the skillet. Cook for 2 minutes before flipping
   over and cooking on the other side for 2 more minutes. Remove from
   heat. If you’re using the blow torch, just graze the roast with the
   flame until browned.
5. Combine the onion powder, beef broth, sugar, Worcestershire sauce,
   salt and 3/4 cold water in a saucepan and bring to a boil over
   medium-high heat. Reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes. Taste and season
   with pepper and more salt if needed. Strain the mixture and discard
   the onions (if there were any in the soup.) Cover and keep warm.
6. Spread the horseradish sauce on one side of each baguette. Dip the
   steak slices in the warm au jus and place on top of the bread with
   horseradish sauce, then place the other slices of bread on top.
   Transfer the remaining au jus to two dipping bowls and serve with the
   sandwiches for dipping.
