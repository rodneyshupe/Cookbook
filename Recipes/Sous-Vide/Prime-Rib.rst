- 3-pound bone-in beef ribeye roast
- Kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon black peppercorns, coarsely ground
- 1 tablespoon green peppercorns, coarsely ground
- 1 tablespoon pink peppercorns, coarsely ground
- 1 tablespoons dried celery seeds
- 2 tablespoons dried garlic powder
- 4 sprigs fresh rosemary, finely minced
- 1 quart beef stock (low-sodium)
- 2 egg whites

Directions
----------

1. Generously season the beef with kosher salt and place in the refrigerator
   for at least one hour (and up to 12 hours).
2. Set Anova Sous Vide Precision Cooker to 132°F (55.5°C).
3. Place beef in a large Ziplock or vacuum bag, seal, and place in the water
   bath. Set the timer for six hours.
4. Preheat the oven to 425°F / 218°C. Remove the beef from the bag, reserving
   the cooking liquid, and pat dry.
5. Whisk together the peppercorns, celery seeds, garlic powder, and rosemary.
6. Brush top and sides of roast with egg white, season with salt, and coat
   with spice mixture
7. Place beef on a sheet ban with baking rack and roast in the oven for
   10-15 minutes, until the crust is dark golden brown. Remove the roast from
   the oven and let rest for 10-15 minutes before carving.
8. While the roast rests, in a large sauce pan, bring the sous vide cooking
   liquid and beef stock to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until reduced by
   half. Skim off and discard any solids that float to the top.
9. Carve the roast, trimming off the rib bones and slicing into six equal
   portions. Serve with beef jus.
