Ingredients
-----------

-  2 cups heavy whipping cream
-  4 large egg yolks
-  1/4 cups granulated sugar
-  1/4 tsp salt
-  seeds from one vanilla bean (you can substitute 1 tsp pure vanilla
   extract or 1/2 teaspoon ground vanilla)
-  Topping/Garnish: berries, chocolate chips, crystallized ginger, mint
   leaves


Directions
----------

1. Set your sous-vide to 183°F (83°C)
2. In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine the egg yolks, sugar, and salt
   and whisk until pale and well-combined. Set aside.
3. Pour the heavy cream into a small saucepan with deep sides and place
   over medium-high heat, bringing only to a simmer. Once the cream is
   heated, add flavoring. *For basic creme brulee, stick with the
   vanilla alone. Otherwise, choose any of the listed options (or even
   try others of your own)*
4. Simmer lowly for 3 - 4 minutes. Remove pan from the heat, and after
   allowing to cool for a couple of minutes, pour a small amount (1/4
   cup or so) of the cream through a fine-mesh sieve or strainer into
   the yolks to temper them. Whisk to combine, and then continue the
   straining and whisking process with the rest of the cream.
5. Divide the mixture evenly between four 4 ounce (or two 8 ounce) mason
   jars with two-part screw-top lids. Attach the lids and screw shut to
   “fingertip tightness”, the variable of “closed-ness” achieved by
   using only your fingertips to screw on the lids.
6. Place the jars into the bath. Cover the vessel with Saran Wrap and
   set the timer for 1 hour.
7. Remove the jars from the bath and dry off with a towel. Allow to cool
   for a few minutes on the countertop before putting in the
   refrigerator for a minimum of 4 hours. They will keep in the fridge
   for up to 5 days.
8. When you are ready to consume, take out of the refrigerator and
   remove the lid. If the surface is not smooth, this can be remedied by
   grazing the surface with the back of a heated spoon (as in dipped in
   hot water).
9. Sprinkle 1/2 tsp - 1 tsp sugar on the top of each custard. Caramelize
   with a blow torch or underneath a preheated broiler.

Flavour Variations:
-------------------

-  1 tbsp Ameretto
-  2 tsp Kahlua
-  1 tbsp citrus zest of your choosing: lemon, lime, orange, etc.
-  1 tbsp fresh ginger
-  1/4 tsp flavor extract such as almond, peppermint, anise, orange, etc
-  sprig of herb such as: fresh basil, thyme, rosemary, mint, tarragon
-  pinch spices: saffron, pumpkin pie spice, nutmeg, ground ginger
-  1 tsp Florals: rose water or orange blossom water
-  1 earl Grey tea bag
-  fresh or dried bay leaves
-  teaspoon dried lavender
-  *the potential list goes on*


Notes:
------

-  This is a perfect temp that allows you to cook with `Glazed
   Carrots <#glazed-carrots>`__.

-  If in a hurry you can cook this at 195°F (90.5°C) for 45 minutes.

-  Instead of putting in mason jars, put mixture into a ziplock bag and
   cook in 183°F water bath for 60 minutes agitating the bag halfway
   through. Once cooked cut corner of bag a pour into four 4 oz ramekins
   and place in refrigerator.
