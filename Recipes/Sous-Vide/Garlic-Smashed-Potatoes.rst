Ingredients
-----------

-  1 pound small Yukon gold or Red Bliss potatoes
-  5 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed
-  2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
-  2 teaspoons kosher salt


Directions
----------

1. Set the Anova Sous Vide Precision Cooker to 190°F.
2. Combine all ingredients in a large zipper lock or vacuum seal bag.
   Seal the bag using the water immersion technique or a vacuum sealer
   on the moist setting. Place the bag in the water bath and set the
   timer for 1 hour.
3. When the timer goes off, remove the bag from the water bath. Remove
   the potatoes from the bag and place on a foil-lined baking sheet.
   Heat broiler to high.
4. Use the flat side of a drinking glass or measuring cup to smash
   potatoes into flat rounds about 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick. Drizzle
   potatoes with some of the infused garlic oil from the cooking bag.
5. Broil potatoes until golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. Flip
   potatoes and broil until golden brown on second side, about 5
   minutes. Serve.
