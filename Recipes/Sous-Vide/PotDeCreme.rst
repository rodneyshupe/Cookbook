Yield: 4 servings

Ingredients
-----------

- seeds from 1/4 vanilla bean (you can substitute 1/2 tsp pure vanilla
  extract or 1/2 teaspoon ground vanilla)
- 1 1/4 cups heavy whipping cream
- 8 egg yolk
- 1/4 granulated sugar
- Maple syrup for drizzle

Directions
----------

1. Heat cream, vanilla seeds and pod over medium heat to 158 ºF / 70 ºC.
2. Whisk yolks, and sugar until smooth. Slowly pour cream into the egg
   mixture 'tempering' the eggs.
   Strain the mixture to remove any 'cooked' egg, and vanilla pod.
   Allow to rest at room temp 20 minutes, so that any bubbles in the
   mixture can rise to the top.
3. Heat sous vide water bath to 175 ºF (80 ºC)
4. Skim away any remaining bubbles.
   Divide the mixture between 4 sealable 4 oz jars.
   Place jars into the sous vide bath and cook for one hour.
5. Remove the jars and place in an ice bath to chill.
6. Serve with a drizzle of maple syrup at the table.
