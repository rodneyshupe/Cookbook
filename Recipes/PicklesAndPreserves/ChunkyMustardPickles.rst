Chunky Mustard Pickles
======================

*Yield: Makes about seven 16oz (pint or 500 mL) jars*

Ingredients
-----------

-  14 cups pickling or field cucumbers (seeded peeled and cut into
   1/2-inch cubes)
-  6 cups onions finely chopped
-  1/4 cup pickling or canning salt
-  3 cups granulated sugar
-  4 tablespoons ClearJel
-  1/4 cup dry mustard
-  1 tablespoons ground ginger
-  1 tsp ground turmeric
-  1/2 cup water
-  2 cups white vinegar
-  1 red bell pepper, seeded and finely chopped

Directions
----------

1. In a large glass or stainless steel bowl, combine cucumbers and
   onions. Sprinkle with pickling salt, cover and let stand at room
   temperature for 1 hour. Transfer to a colander placed over a sink and
   drain thoroughly.
2. Meanwhile, prepare canner, jars and lids.
3. In a large stainless steel saucepan, combine sugar, ClearJel,
   mustard, ginger and turmeric. Stir well. Gradually blend in water.
   Add vinegar and red pepper. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat,
   stirring frequently to dissolve sugar and prevent lumps from forming.
   Reduce heat and boil gently, stirring frequently, until mixture
   thickens, about 5 minutes. Add drained cucumber mixture and return to
   a boil.
4. Ladle cucumber mixture into hot jars, leaving 1/2 inch (1 cm)
   headspace. Remove air bubbles and adjust headspace, if necessary, by
   adding hot cucumber mixture. Wipe rim. Center lid on jar. Screw band
   down until resistance is met, then increase to fingertip-tight.
5. Place jars in canner, ensuring they are completely covered with
   water. Bring to a boil and process for 10 minutes. Remove canner lid.
   Wait 5 minutes, then remove jars, cool and store.
