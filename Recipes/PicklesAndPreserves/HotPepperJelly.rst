This sweet and spicy pepper jelly is so much better homemade.

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 cup apple cider vinegar
- 4 jalape√±os, seeded and finely chopped
- 3 poblano peppers, seeded and finely chopped
- 1 red bell pepper, seeded and finely chopped
- 3 cups sugar
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon pectin

Directions
----------

1. In a blender, combine the vinegar and peppers, and pulse until the
   peppers are finely chopped, speckled throughout the liquid. Transfer to
   a medium saucepan, and add the sugar and salt. Bring to a boil over
   medium-high heat and let cook until the sugar fully dissolves, 5
   minutes.
2. Sprinkle the pectin over the mixture and continue to cook until fully 
   incorporated, 1 to 2 minutes more.
3. Divide the jelly between 2 mason jars, pressing the mixture down until 
   there is only about 1/2 inch of space left at the top of each jar. Wipe
   the rim then affix the lid on each jar.
4. Bring a stockpot filled with enough water for the jars to be completely 
   submerged to a boil. Arrange the jars on a wire rack and lower into the
   water. Boil for about 15 minutes.
5. Carefully remove the jars and let them cool to room temperature on a
   folded towel, making sure not to disturb the lids. Check the seal after
   24 hours; it should not flex when pressed in the center. The jelly will
   keep for up to 1 year.
