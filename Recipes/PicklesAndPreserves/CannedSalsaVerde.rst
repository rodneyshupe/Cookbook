A recipe for canned salsa verde, made from beautiful charred tomatillos,
peppers, cilantro, and cumin, will be one of the best things you did all
summer!

Ingredients
-----------

- 5 1/2 cups (about 2 pounds) chopped tomatillos, husked and cores removed
- 1 cup chopped onion
- 1 cup chopped peppers (i used a mix of green bell, jalapenos, and thai chilies)
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/3 cup minced cilantro
- 1 tablespoon cumin
- 1 teaspoon smoked spanish paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 cup white vinegar
- 4 tablespoons lime juice

Directions
----------

1. Have jars ready for canning, sterilized and hot.
2. Preheat oven to 500 degrees F. Place 3/4 of the chopped tomatillos on a
   baking sheet, reserve remaining 1/4. Roast in the oven for about 20
   minutes or until they are slightly charred and their juices are seeping
   out.
3. While they are roasting, chop the onion and peppers in a food processor.
   Remove and put into sauce pot you will be using to cook.
4. Then remove tomatillos from oven, let cool a few minutes, and pulse in
   food processor along with the 1/4 raw tomatillos that you reserved. Add
   all tomatillos to the sauce pot that has the onions/peppers, along with
   the garlic, cumin, paprika, salt, vinegar, and lime juice. Bring to a
   boil and then turn down heat to a simmer for 12 minutes. During the last
   minute of cooking add the minced cilantro.
5. Ladle hot salsa into hot sterilized jars, and leave 1/2 inch head space.
   Place sterilized rings and lids on top, then return to boiling water
   bath for 15 minutes. Remove and let cool, listen for the pop!
