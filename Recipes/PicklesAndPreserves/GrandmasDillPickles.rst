Directions
----------

Day 1
^^^^^

1. In a large clean crock, glass or stainless steel container, layer
   cucumbers and ice.
2. In a large glass or stainless steel bowl, dissolve 1/2 cup (125 mL)
   of the pickling salt in 4 cups (1 L) of the water. Pour over
   cucumbers and add cold water to cover cucumbers, if necessary. Place
   a large clean inverted plate on top of the cucumbers and weigh down
   with two or three quart (1 L) jars filled with water and capped.
   Refrigerate (or let stand in a cool place) for at least 12 hours, but
   no longer than 18 hours.

Day2
^^^^

1. Prepare canner, jars and lids.
2. Tie pickling spice in a square of cheesecloth, creating a spice bag.
3. In a large stainless steel saucepan, combine remaining 8 cups (2 L)
   water, vinegar, remaining %cup (175 mL) pickling salt, sugar and
   spice bag. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring to
   dissolve salt and sugar. Reduce heat, cover and boil gently for 15
   minutes, until spices have infused the liquid.
4. Transfer cucumbers to a colander placed over a sink and drain. Rinse
   with cool running water and drain thoroughly. Pack cucumbers into
   jars to within a generous 1/2 inch of top of jar. Add 1 tsp mustard
   seeds, 1 1/2 fresh dill heads (or 1 tablespoons dill seeds or finely chopped
   dillweed) and 1 clove garlic, if using, to each hot jar. Ladle hot
   pickling liquid into hot jar to cover cucumbers, leaving 1/2 inch
   headspace. Remove air bubbles and adjust headspace, if necessary, by
   adding more hot pickling liquid. Wipe rim. Center lid on jar. Screw
   band down until resistance is met, then increase to fingertip-tight.
5. Place jars in canner, ensuring they are completely covered with
   water. Bring to a boil and process for 10 minutes. Remove canner lid.
   Wait 5 minutes, then remove jars, cool and store.
