Ingredients
-----------

- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
- 1 pound green onions, thinly sliced
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
- 3 tablespoons sugar
- 11/2 teaspoons flake kosher sea salt

Directions
----------

1. 1. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onions
   and 1 tablespoon of the oil, and reduce the heat to low. Cook,
   uncovered, until the onions soften, about 10 minutes. Add the vinegar,
   sugar, salt and remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, and stir to incorporate.
   Cook until the onions turn deeply golden and fragrant, about 40 minutes,
   stirring every 10 minutes. 
2. Remove from the heat and allow to cool to room temperature before 
   transferring the jam to a mason jar. Seal and refrigerate. Use or keep
   in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.
