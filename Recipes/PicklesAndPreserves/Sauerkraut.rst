Ingredients
-----------

-  1 medium head green cabbage (about 3 pounds)
-  1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt
-  1 tablespoon caraway seeds (optional, for flavor)

Directions
----------

1. Clean everything: When fermenting anything, it’s best to give the
   good, beneficial bacteria every chance of succeeding by starting off
   with as clean an environment as possible. Make sure your mason jar
   and jelly jar are washed and rinsed of all soap residue. You’ll be
   using your hands to massage the salt into the cabbage, so give those
   a good wash, too.
2. Slice the cabbage: Discard the wilted, limp outer leaves of the
   cabbage. Cut the cabbage into quarters and trim out the core. Slice
   each quarter down its length, making 8 wedges. Slice each wedge
   crosswise into very thin ribbons.
3. Combine the cabbage and salt: Transfer the cabbage to a big mixing
   bowl and sprinkle the salt over top. Begin working the salt into the
   cabbage by massaging and squeezing the cabbage with your hands. At
   first it might not seem like enough salt, but gradually the cabbage
   will become watery and limp - more like coleslaw than raw cabbage.
   This will take 5 to 10 minutes. If you’d like to flavor your
   sauerkraut with caraway seeds, mix them in now.
4. Pack the cabbage into the jar: Grab handfuls of the cabbage and pack
   them into the canning jar. If you have a canning funnel, this will
   make the job easier. Every so often, tamp down the cabbage in the jar
   with your fist. Pour any liquid released by the cabbage while you
   were massaging it into the jar. Optional: Place one of the larger
   outer leaves of the cabbage over the surface of the sliced cabbage.
   This will help keep the cabbage submerged in its liquid.
5. Weigh the cabbage down: Once all the cabbage is packed into the mason
   jar, slip the smaller jelly jar into the mouth of the jar and weigh
   it down with clean stones or marbles. This will help keep the cabbage
   weighed down, and eventually, submerged beneath its liquid.
6. Cover the jar: Cover the mouth of the mason jar with a cloth and
   secure it with a rubber band or twine. This allows air to flow in and
   out of the jar, but prevents dust or insects from getting into the
   jar.
7. Press the cabbage every few hours: Over the next 24 hours, press down
   on the cabbage every so often with the jelly jar. As the cabbage
   releases its liquid, it will become more limp and compact and the
   liquid will rise over the top of the cabbage.
8. Add extra liquid, if needed: If after 24 hours, the liquid has not
   risen above the cabbage, dissolve 1 teaspoon of salt in 1 cup of
   water and add enough to submerge the cabbage.
9. Ferment the cabbage for 3 to 10 days: As it’s fermenting, keep the
   sauerkraut away from direct sunlight and at a cool room temperature -
   ideally 65°F to 75°F. Check it daily and press it down if the cabbage
   is floating above the liquid.

Because this is a small batch of sauerkraut, it will ferment more
quickly than larger batches. Start tasting it after 3 days - when the
sauerkraut tastes good to you, remove the weight, screw on the cap, and
refrigerate. You can also allow the sauerkraut to continue fermenting
for 10 days or even longer. There’s no hard-and-fast rule for when the
sauerkraut is “done” - go by how it tastes.

While it’s fermenting, you may see bubbles coming through the cabbage,
foam on the top, or white scum. These are all signs of a healthy, happy
fermentation process. The scum can be skimmed off the top either during
fermentation or before refrigerating. If you see any mold, skim it off
immediately and make sure your cabbage is fully submerged; don’t eat
moldy parts close to the surface, but the rest of the sauerkraut is
fine.

Store sauerkraut for several months: This sauerkraut is a fermented
product so it will keep for at least two months and often longer if kept
refrigerated. As long as it still tastes and smells good to eat, it will
be. If you like, you can transfer the sauerkraut to a smaller container
for longer storage.

Notes
-----

-  Sauerkraut with other cabbages: Red cabbage, napa cabbage, and other
   cabbages all make great sauerkraut. Make individual batches or mix
   them up for a multi-colored sauerkraut!
-  Larger or smaller batches: To make larger or smaller batches of
   sauerkraut, keep the same ratio of cabbage to salt and adjust the
   size of the container. Smaller batches will ferment more quickly and
   larger batches will take longer.
-  Hot and cold temperatures: Do everything you can to store sauerkraut
   at a cool room temperature. At high temperatures, the sauerkraut can
   sometimes become unappetizingly mushy or go bad. Low temperatures
   (above freezing) are fine, but fermentation will proceed more slowly.
