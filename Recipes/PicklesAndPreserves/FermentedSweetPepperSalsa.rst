============================

+------------------+------------------+-----------+---------------------+
| Prep: 10 minutes | Time: 20 minutes | Yield: ?? | Ferment: 14-21 Days |
+------------------+------------------+-----------+---------------------+

Ingredients
-----------

-  5 Medium sweet red peppers
-  5 Jalapenos - Seeds removed
-  1 Medium sweet onion
-  1-2 cloves garlic - minced
-  1/2 to 3/4 tablespoons of kosher or pickling salt

Directions
----------

1. Roughly chop the bell peppers, jalapenos and onions. Then place in a
   food processor and pulse to mince until you have the desired
   consistency.
2. Transfer to a large bowl and add the garlic and salt. There should be
   a fair amount of brine already created.
3. Transfer the mixture into a quart or half gallon jar. Press the
   mixture down with either your hand or a pestle to further extract the
   brine from the veggies. If you are using a weighting system then
   place the weight on top.
4. Seal the jar with your fermenter lid.
5. Wait 14-21 days for the ferment to complete. Begin to taste at the
   two week mark. As long as the ferment is under the brine in the cold
   storage this ferment can last upwards of a couple of years in the
   fridge.
