+--------------------------------------------+--------------------------+

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 red onion, halved and sliced thin
- 1 cup distilled white vinegar
- 1/3 cup sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon table salt

Directions
----------

1. Place onion in medium heatproof bowl. Bring vinegar, sugar, and salt to
   boil in small saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally
   until sugar dissolves.
2. Pour vinegar mixture over onion and cover loosely. Let onion cool 
   completely, about 30 minutes. (The onions will keep for several months,
   but they’re best the week they’re made.)
