Pickled Carrots
===============

*Yield: Makes about seven 16oz (pint or 500 mL) jars*

Ingredients
-----------

-  6 cups white vinegar
-  2 cups water
-  1/2 cup pickling or canning salt
-  4 cloves garlic, halved
-  14 heads of dill (see tip, at left)
-  3 1/2 tsp hot pepper flakes (optional)
-  5 lbs carrots (25 to 30 medium), ends removed, peeled and cut into
   sticks (1 inch long and 3/4 inch)

Directions
----------

1. Prepare canner, jars and lids.
2. In a large stainless steel saucepan, combine vinegar, water and salt.
   Stir well and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring to
   dissolve salt.
3. Place 1/2 clove of garlic, 1 head of dill and 1/2 tsp of hot pepper
   flakes, if using, in each hot jar. Pack carrot sticks into hot jars
   to within a generous 1/2 inch of top of jar. Top with second head of
   dill. Ladle hot pickling liquid into jar to cover carrots, leaving
   1/2 inch headspace. Remove air bubbles and adjust headspace, if
   necessary, by adding hot pickling liquid. Wipe rim. Center lid on
   jar. Screw band down until resistance is met, then increase to
   fingertip-tight.
4. Place jars in canner, ensuring they are completely covered with
   water. Bring to a boil and process for 10 minutes. Remove canner lid.
   Wait 5 minutes, then remove jars, cool and store.

Notes
-----

-  For this recipe, use the dill flower head, which is the yellow flower
   portion.
-  If fresh dill is not available, use 1/2tsp of dill seeds per jar.
-  For quick and easy dilled carrots, use baby carrots, available in
   bags in the produce department of grocery stores.
