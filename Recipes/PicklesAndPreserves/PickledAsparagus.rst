Pickled Asparagus
=================

*Yield: Makes about six 16oz (pint or 500 mL) jars*

Ingredients
-----------

-  7 lbs asparagus
-  Ice water
-  4 tablespoons red bell pepper, seeded and finely chopped
-  2 tablespoons green bell pepper, seeded and finely chopped
-  2 tablespoons hot chili pepper, such as jalapeno or cayenne, seeded and
   finely chopped
-  3 tablespoons garlic, finely chopped
-  5 cups white vinegar
-  1 2/3 cups water
-  1 2/3 cups granulated sugar
-  4 tsp pickling or canning salt
-  2 tablespoons dill seeds
-  2 tablespoons mustard seeds

Directions
----------

1. Trim tough ends from asparagus and cut spears into uniform lengths
   about 3/4 inch (2 cm) shorter than the inside height of the jars you
   are using. In a large shallow dish, cover asparagus with ice water
   and refrigerate for 1 hour. Drain well.
2. Meanwhile, prepare canner, jars and lids.
3. In a small bowl, combine red and green bell pepper, hot pepper and
   garlic. Mix well and set aside.
4. In a large stainless steel saucepan, combine vinegar, water, sugar
   and salt. Stir well and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce
   heat and boil gently for 5 minutes. Add asparagus and return to a
   boil. Boil for 2 minutes or until asparagus is heated through.
5. Place 2 tablespoons (30 mL) chopped pepper mixture, 1 tsp (5 mL) dill seeds
   and 1 tsp (5 mL) mustard seeds into each hot jar. Pack asparagus,
   tips down, into hot jars to within a generous 1/2 inch (1 cm) of top
   of jar. Ladle hot pickling liquid into jar to cover asparagus,
   leaving 1/2 inch (1 cm) headspace. Remove air bubbles and adjust
   headspace, if necessary, by adding hot pickling liquid. Wipe rim.
   Center lid on jar. Screwband down until resistance is met, then
   increase to fingertip-tight.
6. Place jars in canner, ensuring they are completely covered with
   water. Bring to a boil and process for 10 minutes. Remove canner lid.
   Wait 5 minutes, then remove jars, cool and store.
