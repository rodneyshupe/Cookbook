Mustard Pickles
===============

*Yield: Makes about four 16oz (pint or 500 mL) jars*

Ingredients
-----------

-  4 large cucumbers, sliced
-  2 cups sliced onion
-  1 tablespoons pickling salt
-  1 cups white sugar
-  1 tablespoons all-purpose flour
-  1 cups white vinegar
-  1/2 tablespoon ground dried turmeric
-  1/2 tablespoon dry mustard powder
-  1/4 teaspoon celery seed
-  1 quarts cold water, or as needed

Directions
----------

1. Place the sliced cucumbers and onions into a large bowl and sprinkle
   the salt over the top. Fill the bowl with enough water to cover the
   cucumbers. Let stand for 8 to 10 hours.
2. Drain and rinse the cucumbers and onion with fresh water. Sterilize 4
   (pint) jars and lids.
3. In a 6 quart pot, stir together the sugar and flour. Whisk in the
   vinegar, turmeric, mustard powder and celery seed to make a smooth
   paste. Add the cucumbers and onions and fill with enough water to
   cover. Stir, and bring to a boil. Cook until thickened, about 10
   minutes, stirring frequently.
4. Pour into hot sterilized jars filling to within 1/2 inch of the top.
   Seal with lids and rings. Process for 10 minutes in a simmering water
   bath. Refrigerate any jars that fail to seal properly.
