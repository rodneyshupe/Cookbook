Ingredients
-----------

- 300 g Korean radish ( or daikon radish (10 ounces), julienned)
- 200 g carrots (7 ounces), julienned)

   heat and cool it down.
2. Place the julienned radishes and carrots into a sterile pickling jar and
   pour over the brine. Close the lid. Gently move the jar around a little
   bit to make sure the brine is touching the all radishes and carrots.
3. Leave the jar at room temperature for 3 to 4 hours then move to the
   fridge. Chill the pickles for 30 mins to 1 hour before serving for
   optimal taste.
