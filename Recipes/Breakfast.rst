===============================

Source: `Cooks
Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/6977-almond-granola-with-dried-fruit>`__

Ingredients
-----------

-  1/3 cup maple syrup
-  1/3 cup packed (2 1/3 ounces) light brown sugar
-  4 teaspoons vanilla extract
-  1/2 teaspoon salt
-  1/2 cup vegetable oil
-  5 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
-  2 cups (10 ounces) raw almonds, chopped coarse
-  2 cups raisins or other dried fruit, chopped

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 325°F.
   Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Whisk maple syrup, brown sugar, vanilla, and salt in large bowl.
   Whisk in oil. Fold in oats and almonds until thoroughly coated.
3. Transfer oat mixture to prepared baking sheet and spread across sheet
   into thin, even layer (about 3/8 inch thick). Using stiff metal
   spatula, compress oat mixture until very compact. Bake until lightly
   browned, 40 to 45 minutes, rotating pan once halfway through baking.
   Remove granola from oven and cool on wire rack to room temperature,
   about 1 hour. Break cooled granola into pieces of desired size. Stir
   in dried fruit.

*Granola can be stored in airtight container for up to 2 weeks.*

===============

Source: `Cooks
Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/9473-perfect-poached-eggs>`__

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
-  2 tablespoon cornmeal
-  1 teaspoon table salt
-  2 teaspoon baking soda
-  2 egg, separated
-  1 3/4 cup buttermilk
-  4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

*If you’re out of buttermilk, substitute a little less milk (1 1/2 scant
cup) and add 4 teaspoons cream of tartar to the dry ingredients.*

*If using kosher salt, use 1 1/4 teaspoons*

Directions
----------

1. Heat waffle iron. Whisk dry ingredients together in a medium bowl.
   Whisk yolk with milk and butter.
2. Beat egg white until it just holds a 2-inch peak.
3. Add liquid ingredients to dry ingredients in a thin steady stream
   while gently mixing with a rubber spatula; be careful not to add
   liquid faster than you can incorporate it. Toward end of mixing, use
   a folding motion to incorporate ingredients; gently fold egg white
   into batter.
4. Spread appropriate amount of batter onto waffle iron. Following
   manufacturer’s instructions, cook waffle until golden brown, 2 to 5
   minutes. Serve immediately. (You can keep waffles warm on a wire rack
   in a 200°F oven for up to 5 minutes.)

Poached eggs
============

Source: `Cooks
Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/9473-perfect-poached-eggs>`__

Ingredients
-----------

-  4 large eggs
-  1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar
-  1 teaspoon salt
-  Salt and pepper (to taste)

Directions
----------

1. Bring 6 cups water to boil in Dutch oven over high heat. Meanwhile,
   crack eggs, one at a time, into colander. Let stand until loose,
   watery whites drain away from eggs, 20 to 30 seconds. Gently transfer
   eggs to 2-cup liquid measuring cup.
2. Add vinegar and 1 teaspoon salt to boiling water. With lip of
   measuring cup just above surface of water, gently tip eggs into
   water, one at a time, leaving space between them. Cover pot, remove
   from heat, and let stand until whites closest to yolks are just set
   and opaque, about 3 minutes. If after 3 minutes whites are not set,
   let stand in water, checking every 30 seconds, until eggs reach
   desired doneness. (For medium-cooked yolks, let eggs sit in pot,
   covered, for 4 minutes, then begin checking for doneness.)
3. Using slotted spoon, carefully lift and drain each egg over Dutch
   oven. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve.
