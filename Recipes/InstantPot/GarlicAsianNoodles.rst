Certainly not authentic but has that familiar flavour.

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 tablespoons peanut oil (or vegetable, corn, or canola oil) )
- 2 tablespoons sesame oil (any kind)
- 8 - 12 oz shiitake or baby bella mushrooms, sliced
- 1 large bell pepper, sliced into matchsticks
- 5 cloves garlic, minced or pressed
- 1 1/4 cups garlic or chicken broth (I used 2 1/2 teaspoons of Garlic Better Than Bouillon + 2 cups water)
- 8 oz spaghetti
- 1 tablespoons (1/4 stick) salted butter
- 1 teaspoons dried tarragon
- 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
- 1 1/2 teaspoon low-sodium soy sauce
- 1 1/2 teaspoon ginger, minced or graded
- 1 teaspoons chili-garlic sauce or sriracha (optional, for spice)
- 4 green onions, sliced with some reserved for garnish
- 1 tablespoons sesame seeds, with some reserved for garnish

Directions
----------

1. Add the sesame oil to the Instant Pot, hit Sauté and Adjust so it’s on the
   More or High setting. After 3 minutes of heating, add the mushrooms,
   pepper and garlic and sauté for 3 minutes.
2. Pour in the broth and stir well, deglazing (scraping) the bottom of the
   pot to remove any browned bits from the previous step.
3. Break the spaghetti in half and add it to the pot, making sure it’s
   submerged in the broth, but DO NOT STIR. Some of the spaghetti may stick
   up above the broth and that’s fine. Top with the butter and tarragon.
4. Secure the lid and hit Manual or Pressure Cook on High Pressure for
   8 minutes. Quick release when done.
5. While the spaghetti’s cooking, whisk together the oyster sauce, hoisin
   sauce, soy sauce, ginger and chili-garlic sauce (if using), and set aside.
6. When done pressure cooking, remove the lid and stir in the sauce mixture.
   Let sit in the pot for 5 minutes to allow the sauce to thicken. Toss
   in the green onions and sesame seeds and serve.
