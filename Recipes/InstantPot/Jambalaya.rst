A delicious and easy recipe for Jambalaya! This flavorful version can be
made in an Instant Pot or on the Stove Top. Flavorful!!!

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 12-16 ounces chicken andouille sausage, sliced into 1/2 inch thick rounds
- 1 large onion, diced
- 3 ribs celery, sliced
- 1 red (or green) bell pepper, large dice
- 1 jalapeno, finely chopped ( or sub one small can green chilies)
- 4-6 cloves garlic, rough chopped
- 1 14 ounce can crushed tomatoes
- 4 cups chicken broth ( or shellfish broth)
- 1 1/2 cups long-grain white rice
- 2 tablespoons fresh thyme (or 1 teaspoon dry thyme )
- 1 teaspoon dry oregano
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 teaspoons kosher salt, more to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 2 teaspoons regular paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper or chili flakes
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce ( if using chicken broth, trust me)
- 8-16 ounces large raw shrimp ( peeled and de-veined, if frozen see notes)
- Optional additions: 1 cup fresh or frozen peas and 1 cup asparagus, 2 cups roasted veggies, or 1 can cooked chickpeas.
- Garnish: scallions, parsley, hot sauce.

Directions
----------

1. In a Instant Pot, using the saute function, heat oil and add sausage and
   sauté for about 5 minutes or until browned. Add onion, celery, bell
   pepper, garlic and jalapeño, and cook, stirring frequently, about 3
   minutes or until fragrant.
2. Add tomatoes and their juices, broth , thyme, oregano, bay leaves,
   paprika, smoked paprika, salt, pepper, cayenne and fish sauce.
3. Bring to a simmer and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the
   pot ( this will help prevent the &#8220;burn error&#8221; from turning
   on while pressure cooking). I find using a wooden spoon works best here.
   Add the rice, give a good stir (see note about shrimp!)and set Instant
   Pot to HIGH pressure for 5 minutes.
4. Let naturally release for 5 minutes, then manually release, covering
   steam spout with a kitchen towel.
5. Stir in thawed shrimp and let this cook on &#8220;warm&#8221; setting
   for 5-7 minutes ( depending on size), adding peas and asparagus at the
   same time. When shrimp is done ( it will look pink) taste for salt and
   spice level, adding more to taste.
6. Garnish with sliced green onion and chopped parsley.
