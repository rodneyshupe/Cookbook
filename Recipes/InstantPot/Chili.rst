- 2 tsp kosher salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 Tbsp chili powder
- 1 Tbsp cumin
- 2 tsp garlic powder

- Toppings: Fritos, grated cheese, sour cream, diced green or red onions

Directions
----------

1. Turn your Instant Pot to the saute setting. When the display says HOT
   add in the piece of bacon and the onion. The onion will cook in the
   bacon grease. Stir for a couple of minutes and then add in the beef.
   Break up the beef and brown it for 5-10 minutes. If there is excess
   grease spoon it off and discard. Leave the bacon in there for added
   flavor.
2. Add in the kosher salt, pepper, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder,
   Better than Bouillon and adobo. Stir to really coat the beef in all the
   seasonings.
3. Pour the water into the pot and scrape the bottom of the pot so that
   it's clean. Turn off the saute setting.
4. Next layer the following ingredients on top of the beef and do not stir:
   chili beans and juices, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste (in dollops).
   Lastly sprinkle in the cinnamon and cocoa powder.
5. Cover the Instant Pot and secure the lid. Make sure the valve is set to
   sealing. Set the manual/pressure cook button to 20 minutes on high
   pressure. When the time is up let the pot sit for 15 minutes and then
   move the valve to venting. Remove the lid.
6. Stir the chili really well. Then ladle into bowls and serve with
   toppings. If desired refrigerate the chili and warm up the next day and
   serve for even better flavor.
