Ingredients
-----------

The Chicken
^^^^^^^^^^^
- 4 tbsp of butter
- 1 yellow onion, diced
- 2 large carrots, peeled and diced
- 3 stalks of celery, sliced into 1/4″ pieces (with leafy tops reserved)
- 1 tbsp of crushed garlic
- 6 cups of reduced-sodium chicken broth (I used 2 tbsp of Chicken Better Than Bouillon + 6 cups of water)
- 3 bay leaves
- 1/2 cup of Sherry wine (if you leave it out, add in another 1/2 cup of broth)
- 1/2 tbsp of seasoned salt
- 1/2 tbsp of poultry seasoning (salt-free)
- 1/2 tbsp of black pepper
- 1/2 tbsp of rubbed sage
- 1 tsp of dried thyme
- 1 tsp of dried parsley
- Whole chicken (3-4 lbs), chopped into pieces with skin on
- 3 tbsp of cornstarch + 3 tbsp of water to form a slurry
- 1/2 cup of heavy cream

The Dumplings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- 1 1/4 cups of all-purpose flour
- 2 tsp of baking powder (NOT to be confused with baking soda!)
- 1 tsp of salt
- 2 tbsp (1/4 stick) of salted butter
- 1/2 cup of whole milk

Directions
----------

1. Hit “Sauté” on the Instant Pot and adjust so it’s on the “More” or “High”
   setting. Add in the butter and once melted, add in the onion, carrots and
   celery and sauté for 5 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté for 1 minute
   longer.
2. Then, pour in the broth and stir well. Add the chicken and make sure it’s
   all covered by the broth. Toss the in the bay leaves and secure the lid.
3. Hit “Keep Warm/Cancel” and then hit “Manual” or “Pressure Cook” High
   Pressure for 10 minutes
4. When the chicken is done cooking, perform a quick release. Discard the bay
   leaves and remove the chicken from pot with tongs. Set chicken aside in a
   bowl to cool .
5. Add the sherry, seasoned salt, poultry seasoning, pepper, rubbed sage,
   thyme parsley, leafy tops from celery to the pot and stir well. Let the
   pot rest for the time being.
6. While the chicken’s cooling down, make the dumplings by mixing together
   all the dumpling ingredients. Begin by placing the flour, baking powder
   and salt in a mixing bowl and whisk together. Then, place the butter and
   milk in a pyrex and microwave for 40 seconds. Pour the milk/butter mixture
   into the flour and lightly mix with a fork until totally blended so a warm
   dough forms. (NOTE: Don’t overdo the mixing as it can make for a tough
   dumpling). From there, let your hands take over and lightly knead the
   dough. Then, on a clean surface covered with flour, take a flour-coated
   rolling pin and roll the dough to be 1/8″ thick max (it’s very important
   that it’s no thicker than 1/8″ so it cooks properly). Then, using a pizza
   cutter or knife, slice the into the dough vertically into strips about
   1” wide and then slice horizontally about 2” wide, forming little
   rectangular strips. Dust with additional flour so they don’t stick to each
   other.
7. Now give the pot some heat again by hitting “Sauté” and adjust so it’s on
   the “More” or “High” setting. Once it bubbles, stir in the cornstarch
   slurry followed by adding the dumpling strips one-by-one and then give
   them a good stir making sure none are sticking to each other. Then, allow
   them to simmer for 10 minutes with glass lid on pot.
8. After 10 minutes of the dumplings boiling in the pot, hit “Keep Warm/Cancel”
   so the bubbles die down.
9. The chicken should now be relatively should be cool enough to handle. Pick
   the bones clean of all the meat, discarding the bones, skin, and cartilage.
   Rip the chicken by hand into robust pieces and add to the pot
10. Add in the heavy cream and give everything a final stir until well
    combined.
