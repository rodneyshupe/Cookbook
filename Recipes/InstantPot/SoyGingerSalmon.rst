Frozen salmon will cook very quickly and beautifully in the Instant Pot®.
We took advantage of the pressure-cooker function, which can infuse so much
flavor, by adding savory ingredients like soy sauce and lime. Make note
that fattier, thicker fish fillets (preferably center cut) hold up to
pressure cooking best.

Ingredients
-----------

- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon finely grated lime zest and 3 tablespoons fresh lime juice, plus lime wedges for serving
- 3 tablespoons packed brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon finely grated peeled fresh ginger
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 4 frozen skinless salmon fillets, preferably thick center-cut pieces (about 6 ounces each)
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped scallions
- 3 tablespoons cilantro leaves
- Cooked rice, for serving

Directions
----------

1. Add the soy sauce, lime zest and juice, brown sugar, sesame oil, ginger
   and pepper to the bowl insert of a 6- or 8-quart Instant Pot®. Set to
   high saute for 3 minutes (see Cook's Note), stirring the sauce with a
   wooden spoon to combine. Add the salmon fillets, turning them to coat
   with the sauce (it's fine it they overlap).
2. Follow the manufacturer's guide for locking the lid and preparing to
   cook. Set to pressure cook on low for 1 minute. After the pressure-cook
   cycle is complete, follow the manufacturer's guide for natural release.
   After 2 minutes, being careful of any remaining steam, unlock and remove
   the lid. Check one fillet for doneness by gently cutting into it. If you
   prefer your salmon more well done, cook for another minute using the
   high saute setting.
3. Carefully transfer the salmon fillets to a serving platter using a metal
   spatula. Set the pot to high saute for 3 minutes and reduce the sauce
   until syrupy, stirring frequently. Spoon the sauce onto the salmon
   fillets. Top with the scallions and cilantro and serve with the rice and
   lime wedges.
