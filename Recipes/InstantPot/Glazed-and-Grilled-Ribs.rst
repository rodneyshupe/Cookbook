Pressure-cooking the ribs in an Instant Pot makes them completely tender,
the perfect texture for picking up and eating with your hands, with just
the right amount of chew.

Ingredients
-----------

Ribs
^^^^
- 1 tablespoons garlic powder
- 1 tablespoons sugar
- 2 tablespoons mustard powder
- 1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt
- 4 lb. pork spareribs, cut into 3- or 4-rib sections (you can also use beef back ribs)
- 1/4 cup mirin (sweet Japanese rice wine)

Glaze
^^^^^
- 2 Tbsp. distilled white vinegar
- 2 Tbsp. Sriracha
- 1 Tbsp. fish sauce
- 1 Tbsp. sugar
- 2 3" pieces ginger, scrubbed, bruised with the dull side of a chef's knife, sliced into 1/2"-thick rounds
- Kosher salt (optional)

Directions
----------

1. Ribs: Mix mustard powder, garlic powder, sugar, and salt in a medium
   bowl to combine. Pat ribs dry with paper towels and arrange on a large
   rimmed baking sheet. Season ribs on both sides with all of dry rub,
   patting it on if needed. Cover with parchment paper or loosely with
   plastic wrap. Chill at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.
2. Pour mirin into Instant Pot. Place ribs in pot, orienting them on narrow
   sides so they're leaning against walls of pot and each other (rather
   than stacking them flat, one on top of the other). Lock on lid, making
   sure steam release valve is in the proper sealed position. Select
   “Manual” and program for 9 minutes at high pressure. Let pressure
   release naturally 10 minutes, then manually release pressure. Unlock lid
   and transfer ribs to a rimmed baking sheet. Let sit at room temperature
   until ready to serve.
3. Do Ahead: Ribs can be cooked 1 day ahead. Let cool; cover and chill.
4. Glaze and Assembly: Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Clean and oil
   grate. Pour cooking liquid from Instant Pot through a fine-mesh sieve
   into a medium measuring glass (keep sieve handy, you'll need it again).
   Using a spoon, skim off excess fat from surface (you should have about 1
   1/4 cups cooking liquid after skimming).
5. Pour cooking liquid into a large skillet. Add vinegar, Sriracha, fish
   sauce, and sugar and stir to combine. Add ginger, then bring mixture to
   a boil. Cook, swirling pan occasionally, until liquid is reduced by
   half, 7–8 minutes. Strain glaze through reserved sieve back into
   measuring glass and set close to grill.
6. Rub a little bit of oil on ribs to lightly coat. Grill ribs, meaty side
   down, until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Turn ribs, generously
   brush glaze onto exposed side, and grill until underside is lightly
   browned, about 2 minutes. Turn ribs again and brush with glaze. Continue
   to grill, turning and brushing with glaze every 2 minutes, until ribs
   are dark brown and nicely lacquered on both sides with some charred
   spots, about 5 minutes total (smaller end of rack will be done first).
7. As they finish cooking, transfer ribs to same rimmed baking sheet and
   brush immediately with glaze. Let cool 5–10 minutes before cutting into
   individual ribs. Serve with any remaining glaze drizzled over; season
   with salt, if needed.
