Hot, spicy, and satisfying, this streamlined version of the classic Sichuan
dish will take the chill off any evening. It's traditionally made with
fresh noodles; but by cooking dried spaghetti right in the sauce, the
flavors meld into some cross between a pasta casserole and a Chinese
classic. Have lots of beer on hand!

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 tablespoons peanut oil (or vegetable, corn, or canola oil) )
- 1 lb lean ground pork
- 6 medium scallions
- 1 1/2 tbsp Sriracha
- 3 medium garlic cloves, minced (about 1 tablespoon)
- 1 tablespoon peeled fresh ginger (minced)
- 1/4 cup tahini
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 2 tablespoons dry sherry (can substitute dry vermouth or water)
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 8 ounces dried spaghetti

Directions
----------

1. Press Saute, set time for 10 minutes.
2. Heat the oil in the cooker for a minute or two. Crumble in the pork and
   cook, stirring often and breaking up any clumps, until gray but not
   browned, about 4 minutes. Stir in the scallions, sriracha, garlic, and
   ginger. Cook until aromatic, just a few seconds.
3. Add the tahini, soy sauce, vinegar, honey, sherry (or its substitutes),
   and Worcestershire sauce. Stir well until the tahini is uniform in the
   mixture, then stir in the broth. Turn off the SAUTE function, add the
   spaghetti, and submerge the noodles in the sauce without their touching
   the bottom of the insert. Lock the lid onto the pot.
4. Press Pressure cook (Manual) on High pressure for 6 minutes with the
   Keep Warm setting off.
5. Use the quick-release method to bring the pot's pressure back to normal.
   Unlatch the lid and open the cooker. Stir well before serving.
