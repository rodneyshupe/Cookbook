Ingredients
-----------

-  285 grams bittersweet chocolate (about 10 ounces), roughly chopped,
   more as needed (see note)

Directions
----------

1. Create an ice bath in a large bowl using ice and a little cold water.
   Nestle a smaller bowl in ice bath.
2. Place chocolate and 1 cup water in a small pot and heat over medium.
   Whisk until mixture is melted and smooth, about 3 to 5 minutes.
3. Immediately pour melted chocolate into the bowl in the ice bath.
   Vigorously whisk chocolate mixture by hand until thick, 3 to 5
   minutes. The chocolate should be fluffy and form a mound when
   dolloped with the whisk (it should generally have the texture and
   appearance of mousse). If the mixture does not thicken, add a bit
   more chopped chocolate and remelt over the heat. Spoon into serving
   bowls and garnish with fleur de sel.
