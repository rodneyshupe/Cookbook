Chocolate Fudge
===============

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
- 2/3 cup Evaporated Milk
- 2 tablespoons butter or margarine
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups miniature marshmallows
- 1 1/2 cups Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips
- 1/2 cup pecans, chopped (optional)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions
----------

1. Line a 8x8 baking pan with foil or parchment paper and set aside.
2. Add the sugar, evaporated milk, butter, and salt to a medium-sized,
   heavy-bottom saucepan. Stir with a wooden spoon to combine, careful not to
   get sugar up the side on the pot.
3. Turn the heat to medium and bring the mixture to a boil. Stir continuously
   once the mixture is boiling. It will need four to five minutes.
4. Remove the pot from the heat and add in the marshmallows, chocolate, nuts
   (if using), and vanilla extract. Stir vigorously for one minute, until
   everything has melted and is smooth.
5. Carefully pour the hot mixture into the prepared pan. Let cool slightly
   before putting it in the refrigerator for at least two hours.
6. When firm, remove from the pan and take off the foil before cutting into
   squares.
