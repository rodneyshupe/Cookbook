Fresh Strawberry Topping
========================

Ingredients
-----------
- 2 pounds fresh strawberries, cleaned, hulled, and cut lengthwise into 1/4-to 1/8-inch slices
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- Pinch table salt
- 1 cup strawberry jam (about 11 ounces)
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice from 1 lemon

Directions
----------
1. Toss berries, sugar, and salt in medium bowl; let stand until berries have
   released juice and sugar has dissolved, about 30 minutes, tossing
   occasionally to combine.
2. Process jam in food processor until smooth, about 8 seconds; transfer to
   small saucepan. Bring jam to simmer over medium-high heat; simmer,
   stirring frequently, until dark and no longer frothy, about 3 minutes.
   Stir in lemon juice; pour warm liquid over strawberries and stir to
   combine. Let cool, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until
   cold, at least 2 hours or up to 12 hours. To serve, spoon a portion of
   topping over each slice of cheesecake.
