No special equipment is needed to make this ultra-creamy ice cream. Eat
it plain or add some of our fun suggested stir-ins.

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 cups heavy cream, chilled
- 1 cup sweetened condensed milk
- 1/4 cup whole milk
- 1/4 cup liquid sugar (light corn syrup or agave syrup)
- 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon fine salt

Directions
----------

1. Process cream in blender until soft peaks form, 20 to 30 seconds.
   Scrape down sides of blender jar and continue to process until
   stiff peaks form, about 10 seconds longer. Using rubber spatula,

   and salt. Process until thoroughly combined, about 20 seconds,
   scraping down sides of blender jar as needed.
2. Pour cream mixture into 8 1/2 by 4 1/2-inch loaf pan. Press
   plastic wrap flush against surface of cream mixture. Freeze until
   firm, at least 6 hours. Serve.

Salted Caramel-Coconut

The cream mixture freezes more quickly in a loaf pan than in a taller,
narrower container. If you donâ€™t have a loaf pan, use an 8-inch square
baking pan.
