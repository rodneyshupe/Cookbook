No special equipment is needed to make this ultra-creamy ice cream. Eat
it plain or add some of our fun suggested stir-ins.

Ingredients
-----------

Directions
----------

1. For the ice cream: Whisk together the condensed milk, vanilla and
   salt in a large bowl; set aside.

   the condensed milk mixture with a rubber spatula until combined,
