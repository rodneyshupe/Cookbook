All you need to make this mason jar ice cream from Delish.com is a little
elbow grease.

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 1/2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- pinch of salt

Directions
----------

1. Pour cream, sugar, vanilla and salt into a 16 ounce mason jar and
   secure tightly with a lid. Shake the mason jar until the cream
   thickens and almost doubles in size, 4 to 5 minutes. It should
   be opaque and easily coat the back of a wooden spoon.
2. Freeze for 3 hours, or until hardened. Scoop out ice cream with a
   spoon and serve with your favorite ice cream toppings.
