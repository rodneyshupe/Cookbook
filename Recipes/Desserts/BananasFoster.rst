Bananas Foster
==============

In the 1950’s, New Orleans was the major port of entry for bananas
shipped from Central and South America. Owen edward Brennan challenged
his talented chef, Paul Blange, to include bananas in a new culinary
creation - Owen’s way of promoting the imported fruit. Simultaneously,
Holiday Magazine had asked Owen to provide a new recipe to appear in a
feature article on Brennan’s.

In 1951, Chef Paul created Bananas Foster. The scrumptious dessert was
named for Richard Foster, who, as chairman, served with Owen on the New
Orleans Crime Commission, a civic effort to clean up the French Quarter.
Richard Foster, owner of the Foster Awning Company, was a frequent
customer of Brennan’s and a very good friend of Owen.

Little did anyone realize that Bananas Foster would become an
international favorite and is the most requested item on the
restaurant’s menu. Thirty-five thousand pounds of bananas are flamed
each year at Brennan’s in the preparation of its world-famous dessert.

Ingredients
-----------

-  1/2 cup (1/2 stick) butter
-  1 cup brown sugar
-  1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
-  1/4 cup brandy
-  4 bananas, cut in half lengthwise, then halved
-  4 scoops vanilla ice cream

Directions
----------

1. Combine the butter, sugar, and cinnamon in a flambe pan or skillet.
   Place the pan over low heat either on an alcohol burner or on top of
   the stove, and cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves.
2. Stir in the banana liqueur, then place the bananas in the pan. When
   the banana sections soften and begin to brown, carefully add the rum.
3. Continue to cook the sauce until the rum is hot, then tip the pan
   slightly to ignite the rum.
4. When the flames subside, lift the bananas out of the pan and place
   four pieces over each portion of ice cream. Generously spoon warm
   sauce over the top of the ice cream and serve immediately.

Variations
----------

Substitute brandy for rum (and even banana liqueur.)
