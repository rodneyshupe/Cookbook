Ingredients
-----------

Crust
^^^^^

- 6 whole graham crackers, broken into pieces
- 1/3 cup packed (2 1/3 ounces) dark brown sugar
- 1/2 cup (2 1/2 ounces) all-purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 7 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

Filling
^^^^^^^

- 2 1/2 pounds cream cheese, softened
- 1 1/2 cups (10 1/2 ounces) granulated sugar
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 1/3 cup sour cream
- 2 teaspoons lemon juice
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 6 large eggs plus 2 large egg yolks

Directions
----------

1. FOR THE CRUST: Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle
   positions and heat oven to 325 degrees. Process cracker pieces and sugar
   in food processor until finely ground, about 30 seconds. Add flour and
   salt and pulse to combine, 2 pulses. Add 6 tablespoons melted butter and
   pulse until crumbs are evenly moistened, about 10 pulses. Brush bottom
   of 9-inch springform pan with 1/2 tablespoon melted butter. Using your
   hands, press crumb mixture evenly into pan bottom. Using flat bottom of
   measuring cup or ramekin, firmly pack crust into pan. Bake on
   lower-middle rack until fragrant and beginning to brown around edges,
   about 13 minutes. Transfer to rimmed baking sheet and set aside to cool
   completely. Reduce oven temperature to 200 degrees.
2. FOR THE FILLING: Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat cream cheese,
   3/4 cup sugar, and salt at medium-low speed until combined, about
   1 minute. Beat in remaining 3/4 cup sugar until combined, about 1 minute.
   Scrape beater and bowl well; add sour cream, lemon juice, and vanilla and
   beat at low speed until combined, about 1 minute. Add egg yolks and beat
   at medium-low speed until thoroughly combined, about 1 minute. Scrape
   bowl and beater. Add whole eggs two at a time, beating until thoroughly
   combined, about 30 seconds after each addition. Pour filling through
   fine-mesh strainer set in large bowl, pressing against strainer with
   rubber spatula or back of ladle to help filling pass through strainer.
3. Brush sides of springform pan with remaining 1/2 tablespoon melted
   butter. Pour filling into crust and set aside for 10 minutes to allow air
   bubbles to rise to top. Gently draw tines of fork across surface of cake
   to pop air bubbles that have risen to surface.
4. When oven thermometer reads 200 degrees, bake cheesecake on lower rack
   for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes, remove cake from oven and use toothpick
   to pierce any bubbles that have risen to surface. Return to oven and
   continue to bake until center registers 165 degrees, 2 1/4 to 2 3/4 hours
   longer. Remove cake from oven and increase oven temperature to 500 degrees.
5. When oven is at 500 degrees, bake cheesecake on upper rack until top is
   evenly browned, 4 to 12 minutes, placing rimmed baking sheet on lower rack
   to catch any drips. Let cool for 5 minutes; run paring knife between
   cheesecake and side of springform pan. Let cheesecake cool until barely
   warm, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until
   cold and firmly set, at least 6 hours. (Leftovers can be refrigerated for
   up to 4 days.)
6. To unmold cheesecake, remove sides of pan. Slide thin metal spatula
   between crust and pan bottom to loosen, then slide cheesecake onto serving
   plate. Let cheesecake stand at room temperature for about 30 minutes. To
   slice, dip sharp knife in very hot water and wipe dry between cuts. Serve
   with `Fresh Strawberry Topping <#fresh-strawberry-topping>`__.
