Ingredients
-----------

Crust
^^^^^
- 6 ounces saltines
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 10 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 1/4 cup light corn syrup

Filling
^^^^^^^
- 1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
- 4 large egg yolks
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- 1 tablespoon grated lemon zest plus 1/2 cup juice (3 lemons)
- 1/8 teaspoon salt

Topping
^^^^^^^
- 1/2 cup heavy cream, chilled
- 2 teaspoons sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions
----------
1. FOR THE CRUST: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350°F.
   Combine saltines and salt in food processor and pulse to coarse crumbs,
   about 15 pulses. Add melted butter and corn syrup and pulse until crumbs
   are broken down into oatmeal-size pieces, about 15 pulses.
2. Transfer saltine mixture to greased 9-inch pie plate. Using bottom of dry
   measuring cup, press crumbs into even layer on bottom and sides of plate,
   using your hand to keep crumbs from spilling over plate edge. Place plate
   on baking sheet and bake until light golden brown and fragrant,
   17 to 19 minutes.
3. FOR THE FILLING: Whisk condensed milk, egg yolks, cream, lemon zest, and
   salt in bowl until fully combined. Whisk in lemon juice until fully
   incorporated.
4. With pie plate still on sheet, pour filling into crust (crust needn’t be
   cool). Bake pie until edges are beginning to set but center still jiggles
   when shaken, 15 to 17 minutes. Place pie on wire rack and let cool
   completely. Refrigerate pie until fully chilled, about 4 hours.
5. FOR THE TOPPING: Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip cream, sugar,
   and vanilla on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed
   to high and whip until stiff peaks form, 1 to 3 minutes. Spread whipped
   cream over top of pie. Serve.
