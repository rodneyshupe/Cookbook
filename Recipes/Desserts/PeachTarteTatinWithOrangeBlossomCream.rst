This dessert is the definition of low effort and high payoff. With
caramelized peaches, a crisp pastry base and orange blossom cream, you only
need a few simple ingredients to create this decadent and delicious dish!

Ingredients
-----------

- 150 grams (5.5 oz) caster sugar
- 70 grams (2.5 oz) unsalted butter
- 1⁄2 vanilla pod, cut in half lengthways
- 6 peaches, halved
- 325 grams (11.5 oz) ready-made puff pastry
- 250 grams (9 oz) crème fraîche
- 2 tablespoons orange blossom water
- 1 tablespoon orange zest

Directions
----------

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
2. Place a cast-iron pan or an ovenproof frying pan over low heat and add
   the caster sugar and 100 millilitres (3.5 oz) of water. Stir until the
   sugar has dissolved.
3. Once the sugar has dissolved, increase the heat to high and simmer for
   12 to 14 minutes or until the syrup is a light golden-brown colour. Stir
   in the butter and scrape in the seeds from the vanilla pod, then cook
   for another two to three minutes or until you reach a caramel
   consistency.
4. Arrange the halved peaches, cut-side up, over the caramel.
5. Roll out the puff pastry so that it covers the peaches in the pan. Place
   the pastry on top of the peaches and fold the edges down the sides so
   that you're tucking in the peaches.
6. Make three small slits in the centre of the pastry with a sharp knife
   and bake for 45 minutes until the peaches are caramelized and the pastry
   is golden.
7. Meanwhile, to make the orange blossom cream, whisk the crème fraîche
   with the orange blossom water and orange zest, and set aside.
8. When the tarte tatin is cooked, carefully invert the tarte out onto a
   serving dish. Slice and serve with a dollop of the orange blossom cream.

Notes
-----
* If you don’t have orange blossom water, just use the zest of an orange
  instead.
* You can make this a couple of hours before serving, and leave it to rest
  at room temperature (not in the fridge).
* It’s also delicious made with apples, pineapple or pears.
