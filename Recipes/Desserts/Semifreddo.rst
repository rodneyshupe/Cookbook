Semifreddo
==========

Ingredients
-----------

-  3 Snickers Bars
-  50 grams quality Dark Chocolate (70% cocoa solids)
-  1/4 cup caster sugar
-  1 vanilla pod (may substitute a few drops of extract)
-  2 cups of double cream
-  pinch of salt

Directions
----------

1. Roughly chop up three Snickers bars. Place them (saving a few pieces)
   and Dark Chocolate into a mixing bowl over hot water, and slowly
   melt, moving it around with a whisk occasionally.
2. Separate four eggs. Placing yolks in one bowl, whites in another. In
   the bowl with the yolks, Jamie caster sugar and all the seeds from
   one vanilla pod. Beats the yolks, sugar and vanilla together until
   creamy and smooth. In another bowl, whip up double cream until stiff.
   Now turning to the bowl with the whites, add a pinch of salt, and
   whisk the whites until they form firm peaks. Once the whites have
   been whisked to peaks, fold them into the yolks and sugar and then
   also folds in the double cream. Whisk the mixture gently, ensuring
   everything is thoroughly mixed together.
3. To mix the chocolate with the Semifreddo, pour half of the liquid
   into the chocolate bowl and folds together until mixed. Once the
   first half has been folded in, pour in the rest and folds together
   once more. When all of the chocolate has been mixed in, sprinkle the
   remaining chocolate bar over the top, and place the Semifreddo into
   the freezer for around two hours to set.
