-  1/2 cup (3 1/2 ounces) packed light brown sugar

Directions
----------

1. FOR THe TOPPING: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to
   450Â°F. Combine flour, pecans, oats, brown sugar, granulated sugar,
   cinnamon, and salt in medium bowl. Stir in butter until mixture is
   thoroughly moistened and crumbly. Set aside while preparing fruit
   filling.
2. FOR THe FILLING: Toss apples, granulated sugar, and cinnamon (if
   using) together in large bowl; set aside. Bring cider to simmer in
   12-inch ovensafe skillet over medium heat; cook until reduced to 1/2
   cup, about 5 minutes. Transfer reduced cider to bowl or liquid
   measuring cup; stir in lemon juice and set aside.
3. Heat butter in now-empty skillet over medium heat. When foaming
   subsides, add apple mixture and cook, stirring frequently, until
   apples begin to soften and become translucent, 12 to 14 minutes. (Do
   not fully cook apples.) Remove pan from heat and gently stir in cider
   mixture until apples are coated.
4. Sprinkle topping evenly over fruit, breaking up any large chunks.
   Place skillet on baking sheet and bake until fruit is tender and
   topping is deep golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool on wire rack
   until warm, at least 15 minutes, and serve.
