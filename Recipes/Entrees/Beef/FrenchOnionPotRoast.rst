French Onion Pot Roast
======================

Ingredients
-----------

- 1.5kg chuck roast
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 8 yellow onions, thinly sliced
- 3 garlic cloves, chopped
- 1 1/2 teaspoons brown sugar
- 1/4 cup brandy
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 2 1/2 to 3 cups low sodium beef broth
- 4 thyme sprigs
- 2 bay leaves

Directions
----------

1. Heat your oven to 300ÂºF.
2. Place a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Using a paper towel, dry off
   the outside of the roast and season well with salt and pepper. Add the
   oil to the pan and sear the roast until golden brown, about three to
   five minutes per side. Remove the roast to a rimmed baking sheet or
   large bowl to catch any juices and set aside.
3. Turn the heat down to low, add butter and onions, and season with salt
   and pepper. Cook for 20 to 25 minutes or until the onions are golden,
   stirring occasionally. Stir in the garlic and sugar and increase the
   heat to medium. Cook for five to 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until
   deeply golden brown and well caramelized. 
4. Deglaze the pan with brandy and allow to cook away for one to two
   minutes. Sprinkle the flour over the onions and stir well to combine.
   While stirring, slowly pour in two and a half cups of beef broth. Add
   the roast back into the pan and, if needed, add more beef broth halfway
   up the roast. Stir in the thyme and bay leaves, turn the heat to
   medium-high, and bring to a simmer. 
5. Place the lid on the pan and transfer the roast to the oven for three
   to three hours or until the roast is fork-tender. When tender, remove
   the roast from the oven, leave the lid on, and set aside to rest while
   you make the potatoes.
