Ingredients
-----------
- 5 pounds (2.26 kg) meaty short ribs on the bone, 2-3 inches thick
- Salt
- Neutral tasting oil, such as canola or grapeseed
- 1/4 cup (60 grams) soy sauce
- 1/4 cup (55 grams) dark brown sugar
- 1/4 cup (58 grams) mirin (rice wine)
- 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger
- 4 garlic cloves, finely grated or pounded with a pinch of salt
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne
- About 1 cup (228 grams) dashi
- 1/4 cup coarsely chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems
- 4 scallions, green and white parts slivered

Directions
----------
1. Prep the ribs the day before you want to cook. Season the meat lightly
   with salt and let it sit for 30 minutes. Keep in mind that the marinade
   consists mostly of soy sauce, which is salty, so use only about half as
   much salt as you otherwise would.
2. In the meantime, whisk together the soy sauce, brown sugar, mirin,
   sesame oil, ginger, garlic, and cayenne. Place the meat in a resealable
   plastic bag and pour in the marinade. Seal the bag and squish the
   marinade around so all the meat is evenly coated. Refrigerate overnight.
3. A few hours before you want to cook the ribs, pull them out of the
   fridge to come up to room temperature. Adjust oven rack to middle
   position and preheat to 400°F.
4. Set a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat to preheat. When pan
   is hot, drop the temperature to medium-low, add just enough oil to coat
   the bottom. Working in batches so as not to crowd pan, brown a few short
   ribs at a time on all three meaty sides, adding more oil if necessary
   before each batch. Reduce heat as necessary to achieve browning
   gradually; it may take 4 to 5 minutes per side for well-browned ribs.
5. Transfer the ribs, bone-side down, to a large Dutch oven or a large,
   deep ceramic or pyrex roasting dish, then pour the marinade over the
   meat.  It’s fine if the ribs are snug, but they should all fit in a
   single layer. Add enough dashi to go about ¾-inch up the sides of the
   ribs, then cover with lid or parchment and aluminum foil. Slide into the
   oven and cook until the liquid simmers, about 30 minutes, then reduce
   heat to 325°F and cook until meat is very tender and falling off the
   bone, 3 to 4 hours more.
6. Uncover pot or dish and crank oven to 450°F. Brush ribs with the braising
   juices and cook for about until shiny and brown, about 8 to 12 minutes.
7. Serve warm, garnished with cilantro and slivered scallions.

Making Dashi
------------
1. Place water and 6" piece of kombu in a medium saucepan and set over
   medium-high heat. Just before the water comes to a boil, remove the kombu
   and discard. Add the a handful (1/2 cup) of dried bonito shavings and simmer
   for 8 minutes, then turn off heat and let stand 8 minutes.
2. Pour the dashi through a fine-mesh strainer set in a 2- or 4-cup measuring
   cup. You should have 1 1/3 cups (304 grams) dashi. If you do not, add water
   (pouring through the strainer holding the strained katsuobushi) to make the
   amount of liquid needed. Keep chilled in the fridge, use within a day or so.
