Ingredients
-----------

- 4 to 5 pound (1.8kg to 2.25kg) boneless top round roast, tied (see note)
- Salt and pepper
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 carrots, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces
- 1 onion, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch rounds
- 1 celery rib, cut into 2-inch pieces
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon tomato paste
- 2 cans 10.5 ounce (310ml) beef consomme (see note)
- 1 1/2 cups water

Directions
----------

1. SEASON MEAT Pat roast dry with paper towels and rub with 2 teaspoons salt.
   Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours.
2. BROWN ROAST Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to
   225°F. Pat roast dry with paper towels and rub with 2 teaspoons
   pepper. Heat oil in large ovensafe skillet over medium-high heat until just
   smoking. Brown roast all over, 8 to 12 minutes; transfer to plate.
3. ROAST BEEF Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from pan. Add butter to
   skillet and melt over medium heat. Cook carrots, onion, and celery until
   lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add flour and tomato paste and cook until
   flour is golden and paste begins to darken, about 2 minutes. Off heat, push
   vegetables to center of pan. Place roast on top of vegetable and transfer
   skillet to oven. Cook until meat registers 125°F (for medium-rare),
   2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours. Transfer roast to carving board, tent with foil, and
   let rest 20 minutes.
4. MAKE GRAVY Meanwhile, keeping in mind that handle will be hot, return
   skillet with vegetables to medium-high heat and cook, stirring
   occasionally, until vegetables are deep golden brown, about 5 minutes.
   Slowly whisk in consomme and water, scraping up any browned bits, and
   bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until thickened,
   10 to 15 minutes. Strain gravy through fine-mesh strainer into serving
   bowl; discard vegetables. Season with salt and pepper.
5. CARVE Remove kitchen twine from roast. Thinly slice roast crosswise
   against grain. Serve with gravy.
