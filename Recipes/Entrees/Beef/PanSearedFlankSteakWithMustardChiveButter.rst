Ingredients
-----------

-  1 1/2 to 1 3/4 pound (680g to 800g) flank steak, trimmed
-  2 teaspoons kosher salt
-  1 teaspoon sugar
-  1/2 teaspoon pepper
-  3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
-  3 tablespoons chopped fresh chives
-  2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
-  1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest plus 1 teaspoon juice
-  2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 225°F. Pat steak
   dry with paper towels. Cut steak in half lengthwise. Cut each piece
   in half crosswise to create 4 steaks. Combine salt, sugar, and pepper
   in small bowl. Sprinkle half of salt mixture on 1 side of steaks and
   press gently to adhere. Flip steaks and repeat with remaining salt
   mixture. Place steaks on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet;
   transfer sheet to oven. Cook until thermometer inserted through side
   into center of thickest steak registers 120°F, 30 to 40 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, combine butter, 1 tablespoon chives, mustard, and lemon
   zest and juice in small bowl.
3. Heat oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking.
   Sear steaks, flipping every 1 minute, until brown crust forms on both
   sides, 4 minutes total. (Do not move steaks between flips.) Return
   steaks to wire rack and let rest for 10 minutes.
4. Transfer steaks to cutting board with grain running from left to
   right. Spread 1 1/2 teaspoons butter mixture on top of each steak.
   Slice steak as thin as possible against grain. Transfer sliced steak
   to warm platter, dot with remaining butter mixture, sprinkle with
   remaining 2 tablespoons chives, and serve.
