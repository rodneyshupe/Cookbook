Ingredients
-----------
- 2 frozen boneless strip or rib-eye steaks, 1 1/2 inches thick, 1 pound (450g) ea trimmed
- Kosher salt and pepper
- 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice, plus lemon wedges for serving
- 8 ounces (8 cups) baby arugula
- 2 ounces Parmesan cheese, shredded (2/3 cup)

Directions
----------

1. Season steaks with salt and pepper and then grill until browned and
   charred on each side (5 to 7 minutes per side) and an internal
   temperature of 120째F for medium rare or 125째F for medium. Tent with
   foil and let rest for 5 minutes.
2. Slice steaks thin against grain. Fan slices on either side of large
   platter. Whisk oil, lemon juice, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon
   pepper together in large bowl. Add arugula and three-quarters of Parmesan
   and toss to combine. Arrange arugula down center of platter, allowing it
   to overlap steak. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over steak and arugula.
   Serve with lemon wedges.

Notes
-----

If using frozen steaks, Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill
until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave primary burner on high and turn off other
burner(s).  Clean and oil cooking grate. Place steaks on hotter side of grill
and cook covered if using gas until browned and charred on first side,
5 to 7 minutes. Flip steaks, season with salt and pepper, and cook until
browned and charred on second side, 5 to 7 minutes. Flip steaks, season with
salt and pepper, and move to cooler side of grill, arranging so steaks are
about 6 inches from heat source. Continue to cook until meat registers
120째F for rare or 125째F degrees for medium-rare, 10 to 15 minutes longer.
Transfer steaks to wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and let rest for
5 minutes before serving.
