Ingredients
-----------

-  1 medium pear (ripe), peeled, halved, cored, and roughly chopped
-  6 medium cloves garlic, peeled
-  4 teaspoons minced fresh ginger
-  1/2 cup soy sauce
-  2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
-  6 tablespoons sugar
-  1 tablespoon rice vinegar
-  3 scallions, green and white parts sliced thin
-  2 1/2 pounds (1.13kg)  Korean-style beef short ribs that are trimmed of excess
   fat and cut no more than 1/4 inch thick.

Directions
----------

1. Process pear, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, oil, sugar, and vinegar in
   food processor until smooth, 20 to 30 seconds, scraping down sides of
   bowl as needed. Transfer to medium bowl and stir in scallions.
2. Spread one-third of marinade in 13 by 9-inch pan or other suitable
   container that will hold ribs in 2 layers. Place half of meat in
   single layer over marinade. Pour half of remaining marinade over
   meat, followed by remaining meat and marinade. Cover tightly with
   plastic wrap and place in refrigerator. Marinate ribs for at least 4
   hours and up to 12 hours, turning meat once or twice to ensure that
   it marinates evenly.
3. Turn all burners to high, close lid, and heat grill until very hot,
   about 15 minutes. Scrape cooking grate clean with grill brush and
   wipe with wad of oil-soaked paper towels, holding towels with tongs.
4. Grill half of meat directly over burners, with lid down, turning 3 or
   4 times, until well browned on both sides, 10 to 14 minutes. Move
   first batch of meat off heat onto platter and keep warm while
   repeating browning with second batch. Transfer second batch of meat
   to platter. Return first batch of meat to grill and warm for 30
   seconds; transfer to platter and serve immediately.
