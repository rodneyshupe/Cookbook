Ingredients
-----------

- 2 pounds (1 kg) beef sirloin tip oven roasts
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic , finely grated or pressed
- 4 teaspoons minced fresh thyme
- 3/4 teaspoons salt
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1/3 cup dry red wine
- 2 cups sodium-reduced beef broth
- 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh parsley
- 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard

Directions
----------
1. Rub beef all over with oil, garlic, thyme, salt and half of the pepper.
   Place on greased rack in roasting pan. Roast in 450°F oven until beginning
   to brown, about 19 minutes. Reduce heat to 275°F and roast, basting
   occasionally, until instant-read thermometer inserted in centre reads
   140°F for medium-rare, about 1 hour. Transfer to cutting board; tent with
   foil. Let rest for 15 minutes before thinly slicing across the grain.
2. While roast is resting, drain all but 2 tablespoons fat from pan. Sprinkle in
   flour; cook over medium-high heat, stirring, until golden, about 3 minutes.
   Stir in wine, scraping up browned bits with wooden spoon. Whisk in broth
   and remaining pepper; bring to boil over medium heat. Cook, whisking
   occasionally, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Strain through fine-mesh
   sieve; stir in parsley, mustard and any accumulated juices from cutting
   board. Serve with beef.
