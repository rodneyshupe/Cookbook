Ingredients
-----------

- 4 dried guajillo chiles
- 2 dried pasilla chiles
- 2 cups boiling beef broth
- 3 pounds boneless short rib
- 1 yellow onion
- 6 cloves garlic, minced 
- 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
- 1 tablespoon oregano
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 2 teaspoons coriander
- 2 chipotle chiles in adobo sauce
- Kosher & pepper 
- 15 oz. can diced fire roasted tomatoes
- Corn tortillas
- Monterey Jack cheese, shredded
- Diced white onion
- Chopped cilantro

Directions
----------

1. Preheat oven to 350.
2. Remove stems and seeds from chiles and put into a blender, add the boiling
   broth and cover.
3. Meanwhile, season the beef well with salt & pepper, and sear in 2 batches
   in a hot oven proof pot - remove to a plate and repeat with remaining beef.
4. To the empty pot, add the onions with a little more oil and cook until
   softened, about 5 minutes.
5. Add the vinegar, scraping up the bits on the bottom and allow about
   1/2 of the vinegar to evaporate - then add garlic and when fragrant, about
   45 seconds later add the beef back in and take off the heat.
6. To the softening chiles add the oregano, cumin, coriander, chipotles, salt
   & pepper and diced tomatoes.
7. Blend until very smooth and pour over beef in pot - the beef should be
   covered and if not add a little more broth.
8. Cover, and place in the oven until fork tender and shredable - approx 2 to
   2.5 hours.
9. For tacos: dip a tortilla in some of the cooking liquid and place on
   flattop and when it starts getting a little brown, add some beef and
   shredded cheese, fold over and cook until getting crispy on both sides.
   Remove, open up carefully nd add onion and cilantro and eat
