Ingredients
-----------
- 6 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon grated lime zest plus ¼ cup juice (2 limes)
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- Salt
- 1/2 teaspoon grated orange zest plus ½ cup juice
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 2 pounds (900g) skirt steak, trimmed and cut with grain into 6- to 8-inch-long steaks
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 teaspoon baking soda

Directions
----------
1. Combine garlic, soy sauce, 2 tablespoons lime juice, cumin, oregano,
   3/4 teaspoon salt, orange juice, and pepper flakes in 13 by 9-inch baking
   dish. Place steaks in dish. Flip steaks to coat both sides with marinade.
   Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour, flipping steaks halfway through
   refrigerating.
2. Remove steaks from marinade and transfer marinade to small saucepan. Pat
   steaks dry with paper towels. Combine 1 tablespoon oil and baking soda in
   small bowl. Rub oil mixture evenly onto both sides of each steak.
3. Bring marinade to boil over high heat and boil for 30 seconds. Transfer to
   bowl and stir in lime zest, orange zest, remaining 2 tablespoons lime
   juice, and remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Set aside sauce.
4. Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about
   15 minutes. Turn off 1 burner (if using grill with more than 2 burners,
   turn off burner farthest from primary burner) and leave other burner(s)
   on high.
5. Clean and oil cooking grate. Cook steaks on hotter side of grill until
   well browned and meat registers 130 to 135 degrees (for medium),
   2 to 4 minutes per side. (Move steaks to cooler side of grill before
   taking temperature to prevent them from overcooking.) Transfer steaks to
   cutting board, tent with aluminum foil, and let rest for 10 minutes. Cut
   steaks on bias against grain into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Arrange slices on
   serving platter, drizzle with 2 tablespoons sauce, and serve, passing
   extra sauce separately.
