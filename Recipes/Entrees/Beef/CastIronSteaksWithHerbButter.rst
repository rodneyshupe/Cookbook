Ingredients
-----------
- 2 boneless strip steaks 1 pound (450g) ea, 1 1/2 inches thick, trimmed
- Kosher salt and pepper
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 2 tablespoons minced shallots
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh chives
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions
----------
1. Sprinkle entire surface of each steak with 1 teaspoon salt. Let sit at
   room temperature for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.
2. Adjust oven rack to middle position, place 12-inch cast-iron skillet on
   rack, and heat oven to 500째F. Combine butter, shallot, parsley,
   chives, garlic, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in bowl; set aside.
3. When oven reaches 500째F, pat steaks dry with paper towels and
   season with pepper. Using potholders, remove skillet from oven and place
   over medium-high heat; turn off oven. Being careful of hot skillet handle,
   add oil and heat until just smoking. Cook steaks, without moving them,
   until lightly browned on first side, about 2 minutes. Flip steaks and cook
   until lightly browned on second side, about 2 minutes.
4. Flip steaks, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, flipping every
   2 minutes, until steaks are well browned and meat registers
   120째F to 125째F (for medium-rare), 7 to 9 minutes. Transfer steaks to
   carving board, dollop 2 tablespoons herb butter on each steak, tent with
   aluminum foil, and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Slice steaks 1/2 inch
   thick and serve.
