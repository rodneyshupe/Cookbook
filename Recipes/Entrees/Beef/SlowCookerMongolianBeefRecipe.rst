The easiest way you can make a Mongolian beef recipe! The beef gets
meltingly tender in the slow cooker and the sauce becomes incredibly silky,
with great spicy/sweet flavors!

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 1/2 lbs thinly sliced flank steak (1/4 inch thick)
- 1/4 cup cornstarch
- 1 Tbsp vegetable oil
- 3-4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tsp fresh ginger, minced
- 3/4 cup water
- 3/4 cup reduced sodium soy sauce (if you don't have reduced sodium soy sauce use 1/2 cup regular and 1/2 cup chicken broth)
- 3/4 cup light brown sugar, packed
- 2 tsp Sriracha sauce
- 1 cup shredded carrots
- 4-6 green onions, thinly sliced
- sesame seeds, for garnish

Directions
----------

1. Add sliced flank steak and cornstarch to a large resealable plastic
   bag. Close and shake to coat well. This can be done in a large mixing
   bowl as well, but I find it's less messy to do in a bag.
2. To the bottom of slow cooker, add vegetable oil, garlic, ginger,
   water, soy sauce, brown sugar and Sriracha sauce. Stir to combine.
3. Add in coated flank steak and carrots and stir again until everything
   is coated in the sauce.
4. Cover and cook on HIGH for 2-3 hours or on LOW for about 4-5 hours,
   until steak is cooked and tender.
5. Serve over white rice and garnished with green onions and sesame seeds
   if desired.
