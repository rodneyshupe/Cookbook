Ingredients
-----------

Beef Marinade
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- 1 lb (450g) skirt steak, sliced into 1/4-inch pieces against the grain
- 1 1/2 teaspoon light soy sauce or shoyu
- 1 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine
- 3/8 teaspoon MSG
- 1 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt

Sauce
^^^^^

- 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon light soy sauce 
- 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 1/2 tablespoon water

Stir Fry
^^^^^^^^

- 1 lb (450g) broccoli or broccolini, florets separated and stems sliced on a sharp bias into 1-inch pieces (peel stems if they are tough
- 3 tablespoons peanut, or vegetable oil
- 1 1/2 tablespoons minced fresh garlic (4-6 medium cloves)
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger (about 1/2-inch segment, minced)
- 1 1/2 tablespoon Shaoxing wine

Directions
----------

1. BEEF MARINADE: Combine beef with marinade ingredients in a medium bowl.
   Very roughly massage the marinade into the meat for at least 30 seconds.
   Set aside for 15 minutes or refrigerate up to overnight.
2. SAUCE: Combine soy sauce, wine, vinegar, oyster sauce, and chicken stock
   or water in a small bowl and stir together until homogenous. Set aside.
   Combine cornstarch and water in a separate small bowl and stir with a
   fork until cornstarch is dissolved.
3. Heat a couple cups of salted water in a wok over high heat until boiling.
   Add broccoli, cover, and cook until tender-crisp, about 1 minute. Drain
   and transfer to a plate to air-dry.
4. Heat wok over high heat until lightly smoking. Add 1 - 1 1/2 tablespoon
   oil and swirl to coat. Add beef, spread into a single layer and let it
   cook until lightly seared, about 30 seconds. Stir-fry until beef is
   mostly cooked through and only a few pink spots remain. Immediately add
   garlic and ginger and stir-fry until fragrant, 30 to 45 seconds longer.
5. Add Shaoxing wine by pouring it around the side of the wok. Stir sauce
   mixture and pour it in around the sides of the wok. Toss to combine.
   Add broccoli and toss to combine. Stir the cornstarch slurry and add a
   splash. Cook, tossing, until sauce thickens and the chicken is cooked
   through, about 30 seconds longer. Adjust sauce consistency with more
   cornstarch slurry if it is too thin, or a splash of water if it is too
   thick. Transfer to a serving platter and serve immediately with steamed
   white rice.
