Italian Meatballs
=================

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 slices white sandwich bread (crusts discarded), torn into small cubes
- 1/2 cup buttermilk or 6 tablespoons plain yogurt thinned with 2 tablespoons sweet milk
- 3/4 pound (340g) ground beef chuck ( or 1 pound (450g) if omitting ground pork below)
- 1/4 pound (110g) ground pork (to be mixed with ground chuck)
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves
- 1 large egg yolk
- 1 small clove garlic, minced (1 teaspoon)
- 3/4 teaspoon table salt
- Ground black pepper
- Vegetable oil for pan-frying (about 1 1/4 cups)

Directions
----------

1. Combine bread and buttermilk in small bowl, mashing occasionally with fork,
   until smooth paste forms, about 10 minutes.
2. Mix all meatball ingredients, including bread mixture and pepper to taste
   in medium bowl. Lightly form 3 tablespoons of mixture into 1 1/2-inch
   round meatballs; repeat with remaining mixture to form approximately
   14 meatballs. (Compacting them can make the meatballs dense and hard. Can
   be placed on large plate, covered loosely with plastic wrap, and
   refrigerated for several hours.)
3. Meanwhile, heat 1/4 -inch vegetable oil over medium-high heat in
   10- or 11-inch saut√© pan. When edge of meatball dipped in oil sizzles, add
   meatballs in single layer. Fry, turning several times, until nicely
   browned on all sides, about 10 minutes, regulating heat as needed to keep
   oil sizzling but not smoking. Transfer browned meatballs to paper towel
   lined plate; set aside. Repeat, if necessary, with remaining meatballs.

Notes
-----
- When cooking the meatballs you can use less oil and a non stick pan.  Use
  about 3-4 tablespoons of vegtable oil in the pan.
- Serve with `Simple Tomato Sauce <#simple-tomato-sauce>`__ alone or on
  spaghitti with or without `Garlic Bread <#garlic-bread>`__.
