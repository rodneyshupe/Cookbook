Ingredients
-----------

-  2 pounds (900g) russet potatoes, peeled and sliced 3/4 inch thick
-  Salt and pepper
-  1 boneless shell sirloin steak, 1 to 1 1/4 inches thick, 2 pounds (900g), trimmed and halved widthwise
-  1 tablespoon vegetable oil
-  3/4 cup heavy cream
-  1/2 (5.2-ounce) package Boursin Garlic and Fine Herbs cheese
-  2 tablespoons minced fresh chives

Directions
----------

1. Place potatoes in large saucepan and add water to cover by 1 inch.
   Add 1 teaspoon salt and bring to boil. Reduce to gentle simmer and
   cook until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, pat steaks dry with paper towels and season with salt and
   pepper. Heat oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just
   smoking. Brown steaks well on first side, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip
   steaks, reduce heat to medium, and continue to cook until steaks
   register 120°F to 125°F (for medium-rare), 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer
   steaks to carving board, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let
   rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Slice steaks thin against grain.
3. Drain potatoes and return to saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring
   constantly, until potatoes are thoroughly dried, about 2 minutes. Off
   heat, mash potatoes with potato masher until smooth. Microwave cream
   and Boursin together in bowl until hot, about 1 minute, then gently
   fold into potatoes. Fold chives, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon
   pepper into potatoes. Serve with steak.
