Rib Roast
=========

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 first-cut beef standing rib roast 7 pound (3.2kg) aprox. 3 bones
- 1 (3- to 4-bone) standing rib roast, preferably from the loin end, with the fat cap in place, 7 to 10 pounds
- 2 tablespoons neutral oil, to coat the roast, plus more if needed
- Kosher salt, 2 teaspoons per bone
- 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions
----------

1. As many days (up to 7 days) in advance wrap ribs in cheesecloth and
   place in fridge.  If you have less time salt ribs 2 days ahead and
   place wrapped loosely in paper towel in the fridge.
2. When you're ready to roast, remove the roast You can leave it on its rack
   and half sheet pan. from the refrigerator and rub with the oil. Remember
   to rub the bones with oil, as well. Once the roast is completely coated
   with oil, cover the roast with kosher salt, using about 2 teaspoons per
   bone, and the pepper. Let sit at room temperature for 1 hour.
3. Place a probe thermometer into the center of the roast and set its alarm
   for 118°F. Set the roast on the lower middle rack in a cold oven and
   turn the oven to 250°F. Let roast until the meat hits its target
   temperature, about 3 hours for a 3-bone roast or up to about 4 hours for
   a 4-bone roast. (It is more important to keep an eye on the temperature
   than the time here; your times may vary depending on the exact weight
   and shape of the roast.)
4. When the thermometer alarm goes off, remove the roast from the oven,
   transfer to a cutting board, cover with foil, and let rest while
   preparing the pudding. (The roast's internal temperature should rise up
   to around 130°F, then very slowly start to fall.) Pour off the drippings
   from the sheet pan into a heat-proof liquid measuring cup. Let the roast
   rest for 30 minutes. Hang on to the sheet pan and rack; you'll use it
   again later.
5. After 30 minutes, return the roast to the rack and sheet pan, then
   return to the oven. Crank the oven up as high as it will go; ideally
   550°F, but 500°F will also work, and cook until the exterior of the
   roast is browned, 10 to 15 minutes, depending on how hot you can get
   your oven to run.
6. Return the roast to the board, carve, and serve with Yorkshire pudding.
   And no, you don't need to rest it again.
