Ingredients
-----------

-  2 boneless strip steaks 1 pound (450g) and 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 inches thick (see note above)
-  Kosher salt and ground black pepper
-  1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 275°F. Pat
   steaks dry with paper towel. Cut each steak in half vertically to
   create four 8-ounce steaks. Season entire surface of steaks liberally
   with salt and pepper; gently press sides of steaks until uniform 1
   1/2 inches thick. Place steaks on wire rack set in rimmed baking
   sheet; transfer baking sheet to oven. Cook until instant-read
   thermometer inserted in center of steak registers 90 to 95°F
   for rare to medium-rare, 20 to 25 minutes, or 100 to 105°F for
   medium, 25 to 30 minutes.
2. Heat oil in 12-inch heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat until
   smoking. Place steaks in skillet and sear steaks until well-browned
   and crusty, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, lifting once halfway through to
   redistribute fat underneath each steak. (Reduce heat if fond begins
   to burn.) Using tongs, turn steaks and cook until well browned on
   second side, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Transfer all steaks to wire cooling
   rack and reduce heat under pan to medium. Use tongs to stand 2 steaks
   on their sides. Holding steaks together, return to skillet and sear
   on all sides until browned, about 1 1/2 minutes. Repeat with
   remaining 2 steaks.
3. Transfer steaks to wire cooling rack and let rest, loosely tented
   with foil, for 10 minutes while preparing pan sauce. Arrange steaks
   on individual plates and spoon sauce over steaks; serve immediately.

Notes
-----

-  Rib-eye or filet mignon of similar thickness can be substituted for
   strip steaks. If using filet mignon, buying a 2 pound center-cut
   tenderloin roast and portioning it into four 8 ounce steaks yourself
   will produce more consistent results. If using filet mignon, increase
   the oven time by about 5 minutes.
-  When cooking lean strip steaks (without an external fat cap) or filet
   mignon, add an extra tablespoon of oil to the pan.
-  If desired, serve with a pan sauce, relish, or butter; see related
   recipes.
