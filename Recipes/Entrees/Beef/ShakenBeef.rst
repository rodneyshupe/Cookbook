Ingredients
-----------

- 4 teaspoons fish sauce
- 4 teaspoons maggi sauce (substitutue half soy sauce and half worcestershire sauce)
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons molasses
- 1 pound sirloin steak tips, trimmed and cut into 3/4-inch cubes
- 4 ounces (4 cups) watercress, torn into bite-size pieces
- 1/4 cup lime juice (2 limes)
- 1 teaspoon pepper
- 1/4 cup water
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 3/4 teaspoon cornstarch
- 4 teaspoons vegetable oil, divided
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1 small red onion, sliced thin

Directions
----------

1. Whisk fish sauce, soy sauce, and molasses together in medium bowl. Add 
   beef and toss to coat. Let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes. Spread
   watercress in shallow serving bowl. Combine lime juice and pepper in
   small bowl and set aside.
2. Using tongs, transfer beef to second medium bowl, letting as much  
   marinade as possible drain back into first bowl. Add water, garlic, and
   cornstarch to marinade in first bowl and whisk to combine; set aside. Add
   2 teaspoons oil to beef and toss to coat.
3. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat   
   until just smoking. Using tongs, wipe skillet clean with paper towels.
   Add half of beef to skillet, leaving space between pieces. Cook, swirling
   skillet gently and occasionally to capture any fond that collects on
   bottom of skillet, until beef is browned on first side, 3 to 4 minutes.
   Continue to cook, stirring and shaking skillet frequently, until beef is
   coated and browned and center is just pink (to check for doneness, remove
   larger piece and cut in half), 2 to 4 minutes longer. Transfer beef to
   clean bowl. Wipe skillet clean with wet paper towels and repeat with
   remaining 1 teaspoon oil and beef.
4. Melt butter in now-empty skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook, 
   stirring occasionally, until just beginning to soften, about 1 minute.
   Add reserved marinade and bring to boil. Cook, stirring occasionally,
   until thickened and glossy, about 2 minutes. Add beef and any accumulated
   juices and toss to coat. Scatter beef mixture and sauce over watercress.
   Drizzle 2 teaspoons lime juice mixture over salad. Divide remaining lime
   juice mixture among small bowls for dipping and serve with salad.
