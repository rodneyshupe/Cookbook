Serves: 4 as main dish, or 8 as appitizer

Ingredients
-----------
- 2 pound (900g) flank steak, trimmed
- 1/2 cup soy sauce
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 3 tablespoons mirin
- 3 tablespoons sake (or substitute chinese rice wine)
- 16 green onions, trimmed and halved crosswise
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds, toasted

Directions
----------

1. Place steak on large plate and freeze until firm, about 30 minutes.
2. Bring soy sauce, sugar, mirin, and sake to simmer in small saucepan over
   high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Reduce heat to medium and cook
   until slightly syrupy and reduced to 1/2 cup, 3 to 5 minutes. Divide
   evenly between 2 bowls and let cool. Cover 1 bowl with plastic wrap and
   set aside for serving.
3. Place steak on cutting board. Starting at narrow, tapered end, slice
   steak 3/8-inch thick on bias against grain until width of steak is
   7 inches (depending on size of steak, you will need to remove
   2 to 3 slices until steak measures 7 inches across). Cut steak in half
   lengthwise. Continue to slice each half on bias against grain. You should
   have at least 24 slices. Pound each slice to 3/16-inch thickness between
   2 sheets of plastic.
4. Arrange 3 slices on cutting board with short side of slices facing you,
   overlapping slices by 1/4 inch and alternating tapered ends as needed, to
   form rough rectangle that measures 4 to 6 inches wide and at least
   4 inches long. Place 4 scallion halves along edge of rectangle nearest
   to edge of counter, with white tips slightly hanging over edges of steak
   on either side. Starting from bottom edge and rolling away from you,
   roll into tight cylinder. Insert 3 equally spaced toothpicks into end
   flaps and through center of roll. Transfer roll to platter and repeat
   with remaining steak and scallions. (Assembled rolls can be refrigerated
   for up to 24 hours.)
5. For a Gas Grill: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until
   hot, about 15 minutes. Leave all burners on high.
6. Clean and oil cooking grate. Place rolls on grill (over coals if using
   charcoal) and cook until first side is beginning to char, 4 to 6 minutes.
   Flip rolls, brush cooked side with glaze, and cook until second side is
   beginning to char, 4 to 6 minutes. Cook remaining 2 sides, glazing after
   each turn, until all 4 sides of rolls are evenly charred and thermometer
   inserted from end of roll into scallions at core registers
   150 to 155 degrees, 16 to 24 minutes total. Transfer rolls to cutting
   board, tent with aluminum foil, and let rest for 5 minutes. Discard
   remaining glaze.
7. Remove toothpicks from rolls and cut rolls crosswise into 3/4-inch-long
   pieces. Arrange rolls cut side down on clean platter, drizzle with
   2 tablespoons reserved glaze, sprinkle with sesame seeds, and serve,
   passing remaining reserved glaze separately.
