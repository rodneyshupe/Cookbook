Ingredients
-----------

- 3lb (1.5kg) beef short rib (5 – 6 bones)
- salt and pepper
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 large head of garlic, cut in half with skin on
- 1 1/2 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 750ml bottle red wine
- 3 – 4 cups beef stock
- 8 oz Portabellini or chestnut mushrooms, halved
- 3/4 lb thick cut bacon, sliced into lardons about ½ cm thick
- a handful of fresh Italian parsley, roughly chopped

Directions
----------

1. Preheat the oven to 350F. Slice the beef short rib, between the bones, into
   5 or 6 separate pieces. Season well with salt and pepper.
2. Place a large metal roasting tray (dutch oven or large saute pan) heat oil
   over high heat. Sear the beef short rib in the oil, bone side up first.
   Turn it regularly; making sure it is nicely browned on all sides.
3. Add the garlic to the tray, with the sliced side down, and brown it well.
   Stir in the tomato paste, mixing it into the beef and cooking it out until
   it starts to brown slightly. Pour the red wine into the tray and bring it
   up to the boil. Reduce its volume by half.
4. Add enough beef stock to the tray so that the meat is an inch deep in
   liquid. Bring it up to the boil and turn off the heat. Cover with foil/lid,
   making sure that it is tightly closed, and pop into the oven for
   2 1/2 hours. The meat is done when it is soft and almost falling off the
   bone.
5. For the garnish: 10 minutes before the meat is ready heat a frying pan on
   the stove and add the bacon lardons. Fry the bacon until it is crispy and
   add the mushrooms to the pan. Fry them together for a few minutes, and set
   aside.
6. Remove the beef from the oven. Using tongs, place the cooked beef short rib
   pieces on a platter.
7. Strain the liquid through a sieve into a bowl, making sure to push all of
   the soft garlic through too. Season the sauce and pour it carefully over
   the beef.
8. Spoon the crispy bacon and mushrooms over the beef and garnish with a
   sprinkle of chopped Italian parsley.
