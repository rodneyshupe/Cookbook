Ingredients
-----------
- 1 1/2 pounds (680g) sirloin steak tips
- Salt and pepper
- 4 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 10 ounces white mushrooms, sliced thin
- 1 onion, chopped fine
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 1/2 cups low-sodium beef broth
- 1/3 cup brandy
- 1/3 pound (150g) wide egg noodles (3 cups)
- 2/3 cup sour cream
- 2 teaspoons lemon juice

Directions
----------
1. Use a meat pounder to pound the meat to an even 1/2-inch thickness.
   Cutting with the grain, slice the pounded meat into strips about 2 inches
   wide.  Slice each strip of meat against the grain into 1/2-inch pieces.
2. Pat beef dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Heat
   1 tablespoon oil in large skillet over medium-high heat until just
   smoking. Cook half of beef until well browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
   Transfer to medium bowl and repeat with 1 tablespoon more oil and
   remaining beef.
3. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in now-empty skillet until shimmering.
   Cook mushrooms, onion, and 1/2 teaspoon salt until liquid from mushrooms
   has evaporated, about 8 minutes. (If pan becomes too brown, pour
   accumulated beef juices into skillet.) Stir in flour and cook for
   30 seconds. Gradually stir in broths, then brandy, and return beef and
   accumulated juices to pan. Bring to simmer, cover, and cook over low heat
   until beef is tender, 30 to 35 minutes.
4. Stir noodles into beef mixture, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally,
   until noodles are tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Off heat, stir in sour cream
   and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. Serve.
