Ingredients
-----------

- 1 first-cut beef standing rib roast 7 pound (3.2kg) aprox. 3 bones, meat removed from
  bones, bones reserved
- Kosher salt and ground black pepper
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil

Directions
----------

1. Using sharp knife, cut slits in surface layer of fat, spaced 1 inch apart,
   in crosshatch pattern, being careful to cut down to, but not into, meat.
   Rub 2 tablespoons salt over entire roast and into slits. Place meat back
   on bones (to save space in refrigerator), transfer to large plate, and
   refrigerate, uncovered, at least 24 hours and up to 96 hours.
2. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200°F. Heat oil
   in 12-inch skillet over high heat until just smoking. Sear sides and top
   of roast (reserving bone) until browned, 6 to 8 minutes total (do not sear
   side where roast was cut from bone). Place meat back on ribs, so bones fit
   where they were cut, and let cool for 10 minutes; tie meat to bones with
   2 lengths of twine between ribs. Transfer roast, fat side up, to wire rack
   set in rimmed baking sheet and season with pepper. Roast until meat
   registers 110°F, 3 to 4 hours.
3. Turn off oven; leave roast in oven, opening door as little as possible,
   until meat registers about 120°F for rare or about 125°F for
   medium-rare, 30 to 75 minutes longer.
4. Remove roast from oven (leave roast on baking sheet), tent loosely with
   aluminum foil, and let rest for at least 30 minutes and up to 75 minutes.
5. Adjust oven rack about 8 inches from broiler element and heat broiler.
   Remove foil from roast, form into 3-inch ball, and place under ribs to
   elevate fat cap. Broil until top of roast is well browned and crisp,
   2 to 8 minutes.
6. Transfer roast to carving board; cut twine and remove roast from ribs.
   Slice meat into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Season with coarse salt to taste,
   and serve.

Note
----
- Look for a roast with an untrimmed fat cap (ideally ½ inch thick).
- To remove the bones from the roast, use a sharp knife and run it down the
  length of the bones, following the contours as closely as possible until
  the meat is separated.
