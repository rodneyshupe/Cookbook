One Pot Mediterranean Chicken and Orzo
======================================

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 pounds (908g) boneless skinless chicken thighs
- salt and pepper to taste
- 4 tablespoons 60ml) extra virgin olive oil
- 1 large onion diced
- 6 cloves garlic minced
- 1 teaspoon crushed hot red pepper flakes
- 1 1/2 pounds (680g) cherry tomatoes halved
- 1 pound (454g) orzo
- 3 1/2 cups (840ml) low-sodium chicken stock
- 1 tablespoon (22g) honey
- 1 tablespoon dried greek oregano
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) lemon juice
- 1/2 cup (70g) kalamata or gaeta olives pitted, rinsed, and chopped
- 1/2 cup (57g) crumbled feta
- 1/2 cup minced flat-leaf Italian parsley

Directions
----------

1. Pat the chicken thighs very dry with paper towels and season with salt
   and pepper on both sides.
2. Heat a large pan to medium heat and add the olive oil. Once shimmering,
   add the chicken thighs and cook for 4-5 minutes per side or until golden
   brown. Place the chicken onto a plate and tent with foil.
3. Add the onion to the pan along with a pinch of salt. Once the onions are
   soft and translucent (about 5-7 minutes) add the garlic and cook for
   another 1-2 minutes or until fragrant. Add the hot red pepper flakes and
   tomatoes to the pan and cook for 2 minutes or until the tomatoes begin
   to burst.
4. Add the orzo and mix well to coat with the olive oil. Toast the orzo for
   3 minutes then add the chicken stock, honey, and oregano. Bring to a
   boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to low and nestle the chicken
   pieces into the orzo. Cover the pot and cook until the orzo is tender
   and most of the liquid has absorbed (about 12-15 minutes).
5. Uncover the pot and mix in the olives and lemon juice. Remove the pan
   from the heat and add the parsley and feta. If the orzo is too dry add
   a touch more chicken stock and olive oil if needed. Taste test and
   adjust salt and pepper if required. Enjoy!
