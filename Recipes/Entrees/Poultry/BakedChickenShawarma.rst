Baked Chicken Shawarma
======================

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 1/2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs (approx. 6)
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 1 1/2 teaspoons cumin
- 1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 1 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- Pinch grated nutmeg
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions
----------

1. Heat your oven to 350ºF and lightly grease a standard loaf pan with
   non-stick cooking spray. Set a second ungreased loaf pan aside for later.
2. Add the chicken to a large bowl and scatter over the cornstarch, salt,
   cumin, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, coriander, turmeric,
   garlic powder, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Add on the oil and toss well to
   combine and evenly coat.
3. Layer the chicken thighs into the prepared loaf pan. Lightly grease the
   bottom of the second loaf pan with oil or non-stick cooking spray and
   place on top of the chicken into the first pan. Press down firmly to
   compact and transfer to the oven with the second pan still on top. Bake
   for 40 to 45 minutes or until cooked through to 165ºF. Remove the top
   pan and broil on high for a few minutes, if desired, for some crispy
   bits on top.
4. While the chicken cooks, toss the onion with the vinegar and set aside
   to lightly pickle. In a separate bowl, stir together the yogurt, garlic,
   and lemon juice. Season with salt and set aside.
5. When the chicken is done, set it aside for 10 minutes to rest then turn
   it out onto a cutting board. Thinly slice the chicken and assemble the
   shawarma by spreading the yogurt sauce onto the pita and top with the
   lettuce, tomato, cucumber, pickled onion, and chicken. Drizzle with
   tahini, if desired.
