Ingredients
-----------

- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 1 (3 1/2- to 4 1/2-pound) whole chicken, giblets discarded
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1/2 - 1/4 cup wood chip

Directions
----------

1. Combine salt and pepper in bowl. Pat chicken dry with paper towels, then
   rub entire surface of chicken with oil. Sprinkle salt mixture all over
   chicken and rub in mixture with your hands to evenly coat. Tie legs
   together with kitchen twine and tuck wingtips behind back.
2. Using large piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil, wrap chips ( 1/4 cup if
   using charcoal; 1/2 cup if using gas) in 8 by 4 1/2-inch foil packet.
   (Make sure chips do not poke holes in sides or bottom of packet.) Cut 2
   evenly spaced 2-inch slits in top of packet.
3. Remove cooking grate and place wood chip packet directly on 1 primary
   burner. Set grate in place, turn all burners to high, cover, and heat
   grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 15 minutes. Turn
   primary burners (two outside burners) to medium-high and turn off
   secondary (center) burner. (Adjust primary burners as needed to maintain
   grill temperature between 400 and 425 degrees.)
4. Clean and oil cooking grate. Place chicken, breast side up with cavity
   facing toward you, in center of grill, making sure chicken is centered
   between hotter sides of grill. Cover (position lid vent over chicken if
   using charcoal) and cook until breast registers 130 degrees, 45 to 55
   minutes.
5. Using long grill tongs, reach into cavity and carefully lift chicken by
   breast. Holding chicken over bowl or container, tilt chicken toward you
   to allow fat and juices to drain from cavity. Transfer chicken, breast
   side up, to hotter side of grill (without wood chip packet) and cook,
   covered, until back is deep golden brown, about 5 minutes. Using tongs,
   flip chicken breast side down; cover and continue to cook over hotter
   side of grill until breast is deep golden brown, about 5 minutes longer.
   Using tongs, flip chicken breast side up and return it to center of
   grill; take internal temperature of breast. If breast registers 155
   degrees, transfer chicken to carving board. If breast registers less
   than 155 degrees, cover and continue to cook in center of grill,
   checking temperature every 2 minutes, until it registers 155 degrees, 2
   to 10 minutes longer. Let chicken rest, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Carve
   chicken and serve.
