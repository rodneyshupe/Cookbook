Ingredients
-----------

- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces and chilled, divided
- 1 onion, chopped fine
- 5 garlic clove, minced
- 4 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
- 1 serrano chile, stemmed, seeded, and minced
- 1 tablespoon garam masala
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 1 1/2 cups water
- 1/2 cup tomato paste
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 2 teaspoons table salt, divided
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thigh, trimmed
- 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, divided

Directions
----------

1. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion,
   garlic, ginger, and serrano and cook, stirring frequently, until mixture
   is softened and onion begins to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Add garam
   masala, coriander, cumin, and pepper and cook, stirring frequently,
   until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add water and tomato paste and whisk
   until no lumps of tomato paste remain. Add sugar and 1 teaspoon salt and
   bring to boil. Off heat, stir in cream. Using immersion blender or
   blender, process until smooth, 30 to 60 seconds. Return sauce to simmer
   over medium heat and whisk in remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Remove
   saucepan from heat and cover to keep warm. (Sauce can be refrigerated
   for up to 4 days; gently reheat sauce before adding hot chicken.)
2. Adjust oven rack 6 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. Combine
   chicken, yogurt, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt in bowl and toss well to
   coat. Using tongs, transfer chicken to wire rack set in aluminum
   foilâ€”lined rimmed baking sheet. Broil until chicken is evenly charred on
   both sides and registers 175 degrees, 16 to 20 minutes, flipping chicken
   halfway through broiling.
3. Let chicken rest for 5 minutes. While chicken rests, warm sauce over
   medium-low heat. Cut chicken into 3/4-inch chunks and stir into sauce.
   Stir in 2 tablespoons cilantro and season with salt to taste. Transfer
   to serving dish, sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon cilantro, and
   serve.

Notes
-----

If you prefer a spicier dish, reserve, mince, and add the ribs and seeds
from the chile. Serve with basmati rice and/or warm naan.
