Ingredients

-  1 pound (450g) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, patted dry with paper
   towels, trimmed, and cut into 1-inch squares
-  2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
-  1 tablespoon cornstarch
-  1 tablespoon all purpose flour
-  1/4 cup ketchup
-  1/4 cup soy sauce
-  2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
-  1 1/2 tablespoons packed brown sugar
-  3 garlic cloves, minced
-  3 anchovy fillets, rinsed, patted dry, and minced
-  1 teaspoon rice vinegar
-  1 pound (450g) fresh or 8 ounces (225g) dried udon noodles
-  2 tablespoon vegetable oil
-  6 ounces (170g) shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and sliced 1/4 inch thick
-  1 carrot, peeled and sliced 1/8 inch thick on bias
-  3/4 cup chicken broth
-  6 cups napa cabbage, sliced crosswise into 1/2-inch strips
-  7 scallions, cut on bias into 1-inch lengths

Directions
----------

1. Whisk together the sesame oil, cornstarch, and flour; set aside.
2. Whisk ketchup, soy sauce, Worcestershire, sugar, garlic, anchovies,
   and vinegar together in second bowl. Stir 2 tablespoons sauce into
   chicken in a medium bowl and set aside remaining sauce.
3. Bring 4 quarts water to boil in large pot. Add noodles and cook,
   stirring often, until almost tender (center should still be firm with
   slightly opaque dot), 3 to 10 minutes (cooking times will vary
   depending on whether you are using fresh or dry noodles). Drain
   noodles and rinse under cold running water until water runs clear.
   Drain well and set aside.
4. Heat 1/2 teaspoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat
   until just smoking. Add mushrooms and carrot and cook, stirring
   occasionally, until vegetables are spotty brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add
   1/4 cup broth and cook until all liquid has evaporated and vegetables
   are tender, about 30 seconds. Transfer vegetables to bowl.
5. Return skillet to high heat, add 1/2 teaspoon oil, and heat until
   beginning to smoke. Add cabbage and scallions and cook, without
   stirring, for 30 seconds. Cook, stirring occasionally, until cabbage
   and scallions are spotty brown and crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes.
   Transfer to bowl with mushrooms and carrot.
6. Stir the marinated chicken into the sesame oil-cornstarch mixture
   until uniformly combined. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a 12-inch nonstick
   skillet over high heat until smoking; add half of the chicken to the
   skillet in a flat, even layer. Cook, without stirring, but gently
   separating the pieces, until golden brown on the first side, about 1
   minute; turn the chicken pieces and cook until lightly browned on the
   second side, about 30 seconds. Transfer the chicken to a clean bowl.
   Repeat with an additional 2 teaspoons oil and the remaining chicken;
   cover to keep warm.
7. Return skillet to high heat; add reserved sauce, remaining 1/2 cup
   broth, and noodles. Cook, scraping up any browned bits, until noodles
   are warmed through, about 1 minute. Transfer noodles to bowl with
   vegetables and chicken and toss to combine. Season with salt to
   taste, and serve immediately.
