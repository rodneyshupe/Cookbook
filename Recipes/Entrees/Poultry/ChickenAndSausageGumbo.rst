Ingredients
-----------

-  1 cup (5 ounces or 145g) all-purpose flour
-  1 tablespoon vegetable oil
-  1 onion, chopped fine
-  1 green bell pepper, chopped fine
-  2 celery ribs, chopped fine
-  1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme
-  3 garlic cloves, minced
-  1 teaspoon paprika
-  2 bay leaves
-  1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
-  Salt and pepper
-  4 cups chicken broth, room temperature
-  2 pounds (900g) boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed
-  8 ounces (225g) andouille sausage, halved and sliced 1/4 inch thick
-  6 scallions, sliced thin
-  1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar
-  Hot sauce

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425°F.
   Place flour in 12-inch skillet and bake, stirring occasionally, until
   color of ground cinnamon, 40 to 55 minutes. (As flour approaches
   desired color, it will take on very nutty aroma that will smell
   faintly of burnt popcorn, and it will need to be stirred more
   frequently.) Transfer flour to medium bowl and let cool. (Toasted
   flour can be stored in airtight container in cool, dark place for up
   to 6 months.)
2. Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion,
   bell pepper, and celery and cook, stirring frequently, until
   softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in thyme, garlic, paprika, bay leaves,
   cayenne, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and cook until
   fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in 2 cups broth. Add chicken in single
   layer (chicken will not be completely submerged in liquid) and bring
   to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken
   is fork-tender, 15 to 17 minutes. Transfer chicken to plate.
3. Slowly whisk remaining 2 cups broth in small increments into toasted
   flour until thick, smooth, batter-like paste forms. Increase heat to
   medium and slowly whisk paste into gumbo, making sure each addition
   is incorporated before adding next. Stir in andouille. Simmer,
   uncovered, until gumbo thickens slightly, 20 to 25 minutes.
4. Once cool enough to handle, shred chicken into bite-size pieces. Stir
   chicken and scallions into gumbo. Remove pot from heat, stir in
   vinegar, and season with salt to taste. Discard bay leaves. Serve,
   passing hot sauce separately. (Gumbo can be refrigerated in airtight
   container for up to 3 days.)
