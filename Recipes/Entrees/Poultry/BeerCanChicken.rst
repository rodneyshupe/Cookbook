Beer Can Chicken
================

Ingredients
-----------

-  3 to 5 pound (1.4 to 2.3kg) large whole chicken
-  3 tablespoons `Basic Barbecue Rub <#basic-barbecue-rub>`__
-  1 can beer, 12 ounces (354ml)

Directions
----------

1. Remove and discard the fat just inside the body cavities of the
   chicken. Remove the package of giblets, and set aside for another
   use. Rinse the chicken, inside and out, under cold running water,
   then drain and blot dry, inside and out, with paper towels. Sprinkle
   1 tablespoon of the rub inside the body and neck cavities, the rub
   another 1 tablespoon all over the skin of the bird. If you wish, rub
   another 1/2 tablespoon of the mixture between the flesh and the skin.
   Cover and refrigerate the chicken while you preheat the grill.
2. Set up the grill for indirect grilling placing a drip pan in the
   center. If using a charcoal grill, preheat it to medium. If using a
   gas grill, place all the wood chips in the smoker box and preheat the
   grill to high; then, when smoke appears, lower the heat to medium.
3. Pop the tab on the beer can. Using a “church key” style can opener,
   make 6 or 7 holes in the top of the can. Pour out the top inch of
   beer, then spoon the remaining dry rub through the holes into the
   beer. Holding the chicken upright, with the opening of the body
   cavity down, insert the beer can into the cavity.
4. When ready to cook, if using charcoal, toss half the wood chips on
   the coals. Oil the grill grate. Stand the chicken up in the center of
   the hot grate, over the drip pan. Spread out the legs to form a sort
   of tripod, to support the bird.
5. Cover the grill and cook the chicken until fall-off-the-bone tender,
   2 hours. If using charcoal, add 10 to 12°Fresh coals per side and the
   remaining wood chips after 1 hour.
6. Using tongs, lift the bird to a cutting board or platter, holding the
   metal spatula underneath the beer can for support. (Have the board or
   platter right next to the bird to make the move shorter. Be careful
   not to spill hot beer on yourself.) Let stand for 5 minutes before
   carving the meat off the upright carcass. (Toss the beer can out
   along with the carcass.)

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together brown sugar, mustard, paprika,
   balsamic, salt, and pepper. Brush rub over chickens and massage to
