Chicken Shawarma
================

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 1/2 cup plain yogurt
- 5 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon coriander powder
- 1 tablespoon cumin
- 1 tablespoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- Naan and White Garlic Sauce for serving

Directions
----------

1. Cut chicken into even pieces, 3/4 to 1 inch are perfect.
2. Put into a bowl with remaining ingredients, mix well, cover and
   refrigerate 2 hours up to overnight (and of course longer is better if
   you have the time)
3. When ready to cook, heat grill to medium high. Put the chicken onto the
   skewers, oil the grill and cook away - turning often until between
   175 & 180 degrees, then remove and serve with the white garlic sauce.
