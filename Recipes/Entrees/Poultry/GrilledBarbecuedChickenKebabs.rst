Ingredients
-----------

Sauce
^^^^^
- 1/2 cup ketchup
- 1/4 cup light or mild molasses
- 2 tablespoons grated onion (see note)
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 2 tablespoons cider vinegar
- 1 tablespoon light brown sugar

Kebabs
^^^^^^
- 2 pounds (900g) boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts, trimmed of excess
  fat and cut into 1-inch cubes (see note)
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 2 tablespoons sweet paprika
- 4 teaspoons sugar
- 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 2 slices bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 4 12-inch metal skewers

Directions
----------

1. *For the Sauce*: Bring all ingredients to simmer in small saucepan over
   medium heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce reaches ketchup-like
   consistency and is reduced to about 1 cup, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer
   1/2 cup sauce to small bowl and set aside remaining sauce to serve with
   cooked chicken.
2. *For the Kebabs*: Toss chicken and salt in large bowl; cover with plastic
   wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.
3. Light large chimney starter three-quarters filled with charcoal
   (4 1/2 quarts, about 75 briquettes) and allow to burn until coals are
   fully ignited and partially covered with thin layer of ash, about
   20 minutes. Arrange all coals in even layer over half of grill bottom,
   leaving other half empty. Position cooking grate over coals, cover grill,
   and heat grate until hot, about 5 minutes. Scrape grate clean with grill
   brush.
4. While grill heats, pat chicken dry with paper towels. Combine sweet
   paprika, sugar, and smoked paprika in small bowl. Process bacon in food
   processor until smooth paste forms, 30 to 45 seconds, scraping down bowl
   twice during processing. Add bacon paste and spice mixture to chicken;
   mix with hands or rubber spatula until ingredients are thoroughly blended
   and chicken is completely coated. Thread meat onto skewers, rolling or
   folding meat as necessary to maintain 1-inch cubes.
5. Place kebabs over coals and grill, turning one-quarter turn every
   2 to 2 1/2 minutes until well browned and slightly charred, 8 minutes for
   breasts or 10 minutes for thighs. (If flare-ups occur, slide kebabs to
   cool side of grill until fire dies down.) Brush top surface of kebabs
   with 1/4 cup sauce; flip and cook until sauce is brown in spots, about
   1 minute. Brush second side with remaining Â¼ cup sauce; flip and continue
   to cook until brown in spots and instant-read thermometer inserted in
   center of meat registers 160 degrees for breasts and 175 degrees for
   thighs, about 1 minute longer. Remove kebabs from grill and let rest for
   5 minutes. Serve, passing reserved barbecue sauce separately.
