Ingredients
-----------

Chicken
^^^^^^^

-  1 tablespoon kosher salt
-  1/2 teaspoon pepper
-  3 1/2 to 4 pound (1.6 to 1.8kg) whole chicken, giblets discarded
-  1 tablespoon olive oil

Pan Sauce
^^^^^^^^^
-  1 shallot, minced
-  1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
-  2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
-  2 tablespoons unsalted butter
-  2 teaspoons minced fresh tarragon
-  2 teaspoons lemon juice
-  Pepper

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position, place 12-inch ovensafe skillet
   on rack, and heat oven to 450°F. Combine salt and pepper in bowl. Pat
   chicken dry with paper towels. Rub entire surface with oil. Sprinkle
   evenly all over with salt mixture and rub in mixture with hands to
   coat evenly. Tie legs together with twine and tuck wing tips behind
   back.
2. Transfer chicken, breast side up, to preheated skillet in oven. Roast
   chicken until breasts register 120°F and thighs register 135°F,
   25 to 35 minutes. Turn off oven and leave chicken in oven until
   breasts register 160°F and thighs register 175°F, 25 to 35 minutes.
3. Transfer chicken to carving board and let rest, uncovered, for 20
   minutes before carving.
4. While chicken rests, remove all but 1 tablespoon of fat from
   now-empty skillet using large kitchen spoon, leaving any fond and jus
   in skillet. Place skillet over medium-high heat, add shallot, and
   cook until softened, about 2 minutes.
5. Stir in broth and mustard, scraping skillet bottom with wooden spoon
   to loosen fond. Simmer until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 3 minutes.
6. Off heat, whisk in butter, tarragon, and lemon juice. Season with
   pepper to taste; cover and keep warm.
