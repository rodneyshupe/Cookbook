Notes
-----
- The length of brining will determine the saltiness of the bird and how moist
  it will be, if you are going to smoke cook it, you could brine it for longer.
- You can adapt this for Turkey by doubling the quantity and brine the turkey
  for 8 hours instead of 4-5.
- A variation is to add fresh herbs or Chinese 5 spice to the brine.
