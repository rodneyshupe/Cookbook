Ingredients
-----------

Chicken
^^^^^^^

- 1 whole chicken (about 3 pounds)
- 1/4 cups olive oil
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened and cut into pieces
- Kosher salt
- 1 onion, halved
- 1 lemon, halved
- 12 sprigs thyme
- 2 cups dry white wine
- 6 ounces baby arugula

Shallot Fried Rice
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- 1 cup white rice
- Olive oil, for the pan
- 5 shallots, minced
- Kosher salt
- 1 pound shiitake mushrooms, coarsely chopped

Directions
----------

1. For the chicken: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
2. Dry off the chicken well with paper towels. Put it in a roasting pan and
   massage with some of the oil, some of the butter and 2 tablespoons salt.
3. Add the onion halves to the pan, drizzle in the remaining oil and
   sprinkle with some salt. Add the remaining butter to the pan. Squeeze
   the juice from the lemon halves over the chicken and into the pan, then
   place the lemon halves in the cavity of the chicken along with the thyme
   sprigs. Add the white wine to the pan.
4. Put the chicken in the oven, reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F and
   roast, basting halfway with the pan juices, until the thickest part of
   the chicken measures 160 degrees F, about 1 hour. Allow to rest 20
   minutes before carving.
5. For the shallot fried rice: Put the rice in a medium saucepan with 2
   cups water and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cover the pan,
   reduce the heat to low and cook until the water is absorbed and the rice
   is tender, about 20 minutes. Let stand, covered, for 10 minutes.
6. Meanwhile, heat some oil in a saute pan over medium heat until it begins
   to shimmer. Add the shallots and cook, stirring, until browned, about 7
   minutes. Transfer the shallots to a plate or bowl using a slotted spoon
   and sprinkle with a generous amount of salt (use a lot because the
   shallots will be the "salt" for your rice). Add the mushrooms to the
   remaining oil in the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned.
7. Mix together the rice, mushrooms and shallots in a serving bowl. Serve
   the chicken tossed with the arugula along with the shallot fried rice.
