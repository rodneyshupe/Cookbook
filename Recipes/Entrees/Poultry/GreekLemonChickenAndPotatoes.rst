Ingredients
-----------

Marinade
^^^^^^^^

- 8 cloves garlic
- 3/4 cup (180ml) olive oil
- 1/2 cup (120ml) lemon juice
- 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 tablespoon Greek dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 2 teaspoons fine sea salt
- 1 teaspoon black pepper

Chicken and Potatoes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- 8 large chicken thighs overlapping skin trimmed
- 5 medium Yukon Gold potatoes peeled, cut into large chunks, and soaked in water then dried
- 1 sprig fresh oregano optional, for garnish
- 5 slices lemon optional, for garnish

Directions
----------

1. Blend the marinade ingredients until smooth. Place the chicken along with
   all of the marinade in a sealable bag and refrigerated for 2 hours.
2. Preheat oven to 425째F and set rack to the middle level.
3. Add the potatoes to a baking dish and pour half of the used marinade on
   top of them. With your hands, thoroughly coat the potatoes with the
   marinade. Spread the potatoes out into an even layer.
4. Place the chicken thighs on the top of the potatoes, skin side up.
5. Drizzle the remaining marinade onto the chicken. Bake the chicken for
   10 minutes, then turn the heat down to 375째F and continue to bake for
   another 45-55 minutes or until the chicken reaches at least 185째F internal
   temp when checked with a thermometer.
   *Note: If the potatoes are still a bit hard, simply remove the chicken
   pieces to a plate and tent with foil. Raise the oven temp to 425째F and
   return the potatoes back to the oven and cook until tender and brown.*
6. Let the chicken sit lightly tented for 10-15 minutes before serving so
   that the chicken and potatoes will reabsorb the juices. Serve with garnish
   of fresh oregano and lemon wedges.

Notes
-----

- Use two baking dishes if you can not fit everything in one.  Avoid
  overcrowding to more effectively roast the chicken.
- If needed, broil the chicken during the last few minutes to crisp the skin.
