Buffalo Style Chicken Wings
===========================

Ingredients
-----------

-  6 tablespoons table salt (or 12 tablespoons kosher salt)
-  6 tablespoons sugar
-  12 whole chicken wings, about 2 1/2 pounds (1.1kg), separated into sections
   wingtips discarded
-  Ground black pepper
-  1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter
-  1 1/2 tablespoons Sriracha sauce (you can use Tabasco or Frankâ€™s Hot
   Sauce as well)

Directions
----------

1. In gallon-sized zipper-lock plastic bag, dissolve salt and sugar in 1
   quart water. Add chicken; press out as much air as possible from bag
   and seal; refrigerate until fully seasoned, 30 minutes. Remove from
   brine, rinse well under running water, dry thoroughly with paper
   towels, and season with pepper.
2. Turn all burners on grill to high, close lid, and heat grill until
   hot, 10 to 15 minutes. Adjust one burner to medium and grill chicken
   pieces over it, turning once, until color is light spotty brown, skin
   has thinned, and fat has rendered, 15 to 20 minutes. Using tongs,
   move chicken pieces over burner still set on high, turning constantly
   to prevent charring, until wings are dark spotty brown and skin has
   crisped, 5 to 7 minutes longer.
3. Combine butter and Tabasco sauce and toss with finished wings.

Variations
----------

For plain wings, serve with a squeeze of lemon or lime, or with an
accompanying dipping sauce, if desired. If you want BBQ style, in step
two brush with your favorite BBQ Sauce.
