Honey Chipotle Chicken
======================

Ingredients
-----------

- 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts, or chicken tenderloins
- salt and pepper to taste
- extra virgin olive oil
- garlic powder
- juice of 1 lime
- 2 Tablespoon honey
- 2 Tablespoon chipotle powder grill seasoning, divided
  (1 tablespoon for sauce & 1 tablespoon for rubbing into chicken)

Directions
----------

1. Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat.
2. Rub the chicken with olive oil, season with salt, freshly ground black
   pepper, garlic powder, and 1 tablespoon Chipotle powder seasoning. I like
   to rub the chicken with a little bit of olive oil because it helps keep
   all the juices in the chicken and the chicken stays tender & juicy.
3. Reduce heat to medium and place chicken in skillet. Do not overcrowd the
   skillet. Work in batches if necessary. Cook chicken over medium heat for
   about 5 - 6 minutes on each side.
4. While chicken is cooking, mix the lime juice, honey, and the other 
   tablespoon of chipotle powder seasoning.
5. After chicken is done, place it on a plate and brush with the honey
   chipotle mixture. You can serve it with your favorite side of vegetables,
   over mashed potatoes, rice, quinoa or top a big green salad.
