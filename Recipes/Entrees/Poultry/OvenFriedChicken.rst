Ingredients
-----------

Marinade
^^^^^^^^

-  2 cups buttermilk  (substitute 1 tablespoon of cream of tartar and 2 cups regular milk)
-  2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
-  2 teaspoons table salt
-  1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
-  1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper
-  1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
-  8 split bone-in chicken breasts, 10 to 12 ounces (280g to 340g) each, skin removed and ribs trimmed with kitchen shears

Seasoned flour
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  2 1/2 cups crushed corn flakes
-  3/4 cup fresh bread crumbs
-  1/4 teaspoons table salt
-  1/2 teaspoon ground poultry seasoning
-  1/2 teaspoon paprika
-  1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
-  2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions
----------

1. Whisk buttermilk, mustard, 2 teaspoons salt, 1 teaspoon garlic
   powder, 1 teaspoon black pepper, and hot sauce together in large
   bowl. Add chicken, turn to coat well, cover, and refrigerate at least
   1 hour or overnight.
2. Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 400°F.
   Line rimmed baking sheet with foil, set wire rack on sheet, and coat
   rack with nonstick cooking spray.
3. Gently toss corn flakes, bread crumbs, remaining 1/2 teaspoon garlic
   powder, remaining 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, remaining 1/4 teaspoon
   salt, poultry seasoning, paprika, and cayenne in shallow dish until
   combined. Drizzle oil over crumbs and toss until well coated. Working
   with one piece at a time, remove chicken from marinade and dredge in
   crumb mixture, firmly pressing crumbs onto all sides of chicken.
   Place chicken on prepared rack, leaving 1/2 inch of space between
   each piece.
4. Bake until chicken is deep golden brown, juices run clear, and
   instant-read thermometer inserted deep into breast away from bone
   registers 160°F, 35 to 45 minutes.

Variation
---------

To create a spicier version adjust the breading by leaving out salt and
increasing cayenne pepper to 1/4 teaspoon and adding 1/2 teaspoon chili
powder.
