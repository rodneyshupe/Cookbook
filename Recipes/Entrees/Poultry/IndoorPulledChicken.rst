Ingredients
-----------

Sauce
^^^^^

-  1 1/2 cups ketchup
-  1/4 cup molasses
-  2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
-  1 tablespoon hot sauce
-  1/2 teaspoon salt
-  1/2 teaspoon pepper

Chicken
^^^^^^^

-  1 cup chicken broth
-  2 tablespoons molasses
-  1 tablespoon sugar
-  1 tablespoon liquid smoke
-  1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin (ClearJel)
-  Salt and pepper
-  2 pounds (900g) boneless, skinless chicken thighs, halved crosswise
-  Hot sauce

Directions
----------

1. FOR THE SAUCE: Whisk all ingredients together in bowl. Set aside.
2. FOR THE CHICKEN: Bring broth, molasses, sugar, 2 teaspoons liquid
   smoke, gelatin, and 1 teaspoon salt to boil in large Dutch oven over
   high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Add chicken and return to
   simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook, stirring
   occasionally, until chicken is easily shredded with fork, about 25
   minutes.
3. Transfer chicken to medium bowl and set aside. Strain cooking liquid
   through fine-mesh strainer set over bowl (do not wash pot). Let
   liquid settle for 5 minutes; skim fat from surface. Set aside fat and
   defatted liquid.
4. Using tongs, squeeze chicken until shredded into bite-size pieces.
   Transfer chicken, 1 cup sauce, 1/2 cup reserved defatted liquid, 3
   tablespoons reserved fat, and remaining 1 teaspoon liquid smoke to
   now-empty pot. Cook mixture over medium heat, stirring frequently,
   until liquid has been absorbed and exterior of meat appears dry,
   about 5 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and hot sauce to taste.
   Serve, passing remaining sauce separately.
