====================

Ingredients
-----------

Marinade
^^^^^^^^

- 1 lb (450 g) boneless skinless chicken breast (or thigh)
- 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch

Sauce
^^^^^

- 3 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)
- 1/2 tablespoon dark soy sauce (or soy sauce)
- 1/4 cup chicken stock
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

Stir-fry
^^^^^^^^

- 1 head broccoli , chopped into bite-sized florets
- 2 tablespoons peanut oil (or vegetable oil)
- 4 cloves garlic , minced
- 1 teaspoon ginger , minced

Directions
----------

1. Slice the chicken against the grain into thin bite-size pieces, no
   thicker than 1/4‚Äù (1/2 cm), transfer into a medium-size bowl. Add the
   marinade ingredients. Stir to mix well. Let sit for 10 minutes while
   preparing other ingredients.
2. Combine all the sauce ingredients in a bowl. Stir to mix well.
3. Bring 1/3 cup of water to a boil in a large nonstick skillet over
   medium-high heat. Add the broccoli and cover. Steam until the broccoli
   just turns tender and the water evaporates, about 40 to 50 seconds.
   Transfer the broccoli to a plate. Wipe the pan with a paper towel held
   in a pair of tongs if there's any water left.
4. Add the oil and swirl to coat the bottom. Spread the chicken in the
   skillet in a single layer. Allow to cook without touching for 30 seconds,
   or until the bottom side is browned. Flip to cook the other side for a
   few seconds. Stir and cook until the surface is lightly charred and the
   inside is still pink.
5. Add the garlic and ginger. Stir a few times to release the flavor and
   fragrance.
6. Return the broccoli to the pan. Stir the sauce again to dissolve the
   cornstarch completely and pour it into the skillet. Cook and stir until
   the sauce thickens, about 1 minute. Transfer everything to a plate
   immediately.
7. Serve hot with steamed rice or boiled noodles as a main dish.
