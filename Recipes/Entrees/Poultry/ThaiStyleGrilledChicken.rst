Ingredients
-----------

Hens
^^^^
- 4 Cornish game hens, 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds (570g to 680g) each, giblets discarded
- 1 cup fresh cilantro leaves and stems, chopped coarse
- 12 garlic cloves, peeled
- 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons ground white pepper
- 2 teaspoons ground coriander
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1/4 cup fish sauce

Dipping Sauce
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- 1/2 cup distilled white vinegar
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon minced Thai chiles
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions
----------
1. FOR THE HENS: Working with 1 hen at a time, place hens breast side down on
   cutting board and use kitchen shears to cut through bones on either side of
   backbones; discard backbones. Flip hens and press on breastbones to
   flatten. Trim any excess fat and skin.
2. Pulse cilantro leaves and stems, garlic, sugar, pepper, coriander, and salt
   in food processor until finely chopped, 10 to 15 pulses; transfer to small
   bowl. Add fish sauce and stir until marinade has consistency of loose paste.
3. Rub hens all over with marinade. Transfer hens and any excess marinade to
   1-gallon zipper-lock bag and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or up to
   24 hours, flipping bag halfway through marinating.
4. FOR THE DIPPING SAUCE: Bring vinegar to boil in small saucepan. Add sugar
   and stir to dissolve. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until vinegar
   mixture is slightly thickened, 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let vinegar
   mixture cool completely. Add chiles, garlic, and salt and stir until
   combined. Transfer sauce to airtight container and refrigerate until ready
   to use. (Sauce can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks. Bring to room
   temperature before serving.)
5. GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about
   15 minutes. Leave primary burner on high and turn off other burner(s).
   Adjust primary burner (or, if using three-burner grill, primary burner and
   second burner) as needed to maintain grill temperature between 400 and
   450°F.
6. Clean and oil cooking grate. Remove hens from bag, leaving any marinade
   that sticks to hens in place. Tuck wingtips behind backs and turn legs so
   drumsticks face inward toward breasts. Place hens, skin side up, on cooler
   side of grill (if using charcoal, arrange hens so that legs and thighs
   are facing coals). Cover and cook until skin is browned and breasts
   register 145 to 150°F, 30 to 35 minutes, rotating hens halfway
   through cooking.
7. Using tongs, carefully flip hens skin side down and move to hotter side of
   grill. Cover and cook until skin is crisp, deeply browned, and charred in
   spots and breasts register 160°F, 3 to 5 minutes, being careful to
   avoid burning.
8. Transfer hens, skin side up, to cutting board; tent with aluminum foil
   and let rest for 10 minutes. Slice each hen in half or into 4 pieces and
   serve, passing dipping sauce separately.
