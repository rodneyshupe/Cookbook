Ingredients
-----------

- 2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs
- 3 peeled whole garlic cloves
- 1 large yellow onion, halved
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- 4 cups chicken stock
- 1 cup water
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large onion, diced
- 1 (7 ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
- 1 (28 ounce) can peeled plum tomatoes (preferably San Marzano)
- 2 tablespoons crumbled cotija cheese, or to taste
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, or more to taste

Directions
----------

1. Place chicken thighs, garlic cloves, halved onion, salt, oregano, water,
   and chicken stock, and water in a large pot. Bring to a simmer over high
   heat; reduce to medium-low. Simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
   Remove from heat.
2. Transfer onion halves to a bowl with a slotted spoon; transfer chicken
   thighs to a separate bowl.
3. Pour broth through a strainer into a large bowl.
4. Heat olive oil in the same pot over medium heat. Add diced onions and
   cook until beginning to soften, about 4 minutes. Transfer strained
   liquid to onions. Bring mixture to a boil over high heat; turn heat to
   medium-low; reduce broth by about half, about 20 minutes.
5. Transfer reserved boiled onions to a blender. Add chipotle peppers and
   the adobo sauce. Swirl a bit of water in the can and add to the blender.
   Add tomatoes. Cover blender with the lid. Pulse on and off until mixture
   is partially blended. Blend on medium speed until smooth, 1 or 2
   minutes. Transfer to pot with broth and onions.
6. Increase heat to medium-high. Simmer 15-30 minutes, depending on how
   thick you want the sauce. Reduce heat to medium-low.  Remove approx.
   half the sauce and reserve for another use.
7. Tear chicken into bite-size pieces and add to the pot. Cook another 10
   to 15 minutes. Transfer to a serving dish; garnish with crumbled cotija
   cheese and cilantro.
