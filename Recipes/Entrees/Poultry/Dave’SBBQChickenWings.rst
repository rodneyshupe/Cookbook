Dave’s BBQ Chicken Wings
========================

Ingredients
-----------

-  6 tablespoons table salt (or 12 tablespoons kosher salt)
-  6 tablespoons sugar
-  12 whole chicken wings
-  `Basic Barbecue Rub <#basic-barbecue-rub>`__
-  `Cajun Spice Mix <#louisiana-cajun-or-creole-seasoning-spice-mix>`__
-  Bacon Fat

Directions
----------

1. Dissolve sugar and salt in 4 cups of water in a one gallon-size zip
   lock freezer bag. Add chicken and press out as much air as possible
   from the bag and seal. Place in refrigerator for 30 minutes.
2. Remove chicken from brine and pat dry with paper towel. Apply equal
   amounts of Basic Barbecue Rub and Cajun Spice Mix or to taste, lay
   out in a cookie sheet with a wire rack so they are not overlapping
   and let sit in the fridge for at least 3-4 hours to dry.
3. When ready get the smoke going (or not) and put the wings on one side
   of the grill, that side on the lowest setting. The smoking side low
   to medium heat. Flip wings over after 15 minutes or more frequently
   if the heat is high, you are looking to get them smokey and dry.
   After about 30 minutes baste wings with melted bacon fat, flip and
   baste again you can do this a couple of times if you like. There
   should be no flare ups or little on the wing side but the low heat is
   to apply extra cooking/drying and prevents the worst of the fat build
   up.
4. Keep smoking and cooking until the skin is getting crispy. It should
   be greyish from the spices and smoke. At this point you can raise the
   heat and switch them to the smoking side to crisp up more, if you do
   it on the wings side get ready for lots of flames. When done to your
   liking take them off and pour on as much room temperature BBQ sauce
   as you like, we coated about half of each wing drizzling with a table
   spoon. Overall don’t cook them too long, 40-50 minutes total time
   from when they went on the grill.

Variation
---------

Alternate brine: Substitute sugar with 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce.
