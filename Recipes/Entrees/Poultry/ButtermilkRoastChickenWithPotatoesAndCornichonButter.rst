Ingredients
-----------
- 1 whole chicken, about 4 pounds (1.8 kg)
- 1 cup buttermilk (substitute 1 1/2 teaspoons of cream of tartar and 1 cup regular milk)
- 1 cup pickle juice, from any type of pickles (dill, bread and butter, spicy garlic, etc.)
- 1 pinch kosher salt, to taste
- 1 1/2 pounds (680g) baby potatoes, halved, or small golden potatoes, peeled and sliced 1/4-inch thick (up to 2 pounds of potatoes)
- 1 splash olive oil
- 1 tablespoon butter, softened
- 4 cornichons, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped flat-leaf parsley

Directions
----------
1. Mix together buttermilk, pickle juice, and 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Place
   chicken in a gallon-sized plastic zipper-lock bag. Pour in the brine. Seal
   the bag, pressing out as much air as possible. Refrigerate 6 to 24 hours
   (a longer brine will result in a more flavorful bird).
2. About an hour before you roast the chicken, remove chicken from the bag and
   discard brine. Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Rub a little olive oil on
   the bottom of a large baking dish or ovenproof skillet (one large enough to
   hold the potatoes). Place the chicken in the middle of the dish,
   breast-side up, and let it come to room temperature.
3. Heat oven to 425° F.
4. Toss potatoes with 1 tablespoon olive oil and kosher salt, to taste.
   Arrange potatoes around the chicken. Evenly rub the chicken with 1/2 to
   1 tablespoon olive oil. Season the chicken and potatoes with freshly
   cracked black pepper.
5. Place the chicken and potatoes in the oven and roast for about
   50 to 70 minutes, rotating once, until the juices run clear or the thickest
   part of the thigh registers 165° F. (If the chicken is browning too quickly
   relative to its internal temperature, reduce the oven to 375° F to 400° F.)
6. Meanwhile, mash together the butter and cornichons with a fork. Don’t worry
   if they’re not completely integrated.
7. When the chicken is done, immediately remove it from the pan and rest on a
   cutting board for 10 to 15 minutes before carving. Add the cornichon butter
   and parsley to the hot potatoes. Once it starts to melt, toss to evenly
   integrate.
