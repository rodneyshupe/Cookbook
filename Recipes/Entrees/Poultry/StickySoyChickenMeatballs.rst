Ingredients
-----------

Chicken Balls
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- 1 lb ground chicken
- 2 green onions finely chopped
- 2 garlic gloves finely minced
- 1 tablespoon finely grated ginger
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil
- 1/2 cup panko
- 1 egg

Sauce
^^^^^
- 1/4 soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
- 1 clove garlic
- 1 tablespoon finely grated ginger
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1/4 cup hoisin sauce
- 2 tablespoons honey


Directions
----------
1. Heat your oven to 400ÂºF and line a sheet pan with parchment paper or
   lightly grease with non-stick cooking spray.
2. Add the ground chicken, green onions, garlic, ginger, soy sauce,
   sesame oil, panko, and egg to a large bowl. Using two forks, stir and
   toss together until well combined.
3. Scoop 1 tablespoon portions of the chicken mixture onto the prepared
   sheet pan and roll into small meatballs. If the mixture is sticking to
   your hands, lightly dampen your hands with a little water.
4. Bake the meatballs for 12 to 14 minutes or until cooked through and
   lightly golden brown. If desired, you can broil the meatballs on high
   for 1 minute to get a little extra colour on the top.
5. Meanwhile, prepare the sauce by combining the soy sauce, rice wine
   vinegar, garlic, ginger, and pepper flakes in a small pan or pot.
   Place over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Cook for 5 minutes until
   slightly reduced. Add in the hoisin and honey and continue to simmer
   for 2 to 3 minutes until thickened.
6. Serve the meatballs with the sauce spooned over top with rice, thinly
   sliced veggies, and cilantro or mint.

Variations
----------
Substitute chicken for pork or turkey.
