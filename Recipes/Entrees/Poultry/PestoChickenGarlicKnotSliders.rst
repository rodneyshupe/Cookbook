=================================

Ingredients
-----------
- 1 1/2 pounds (680g) pizza dough
- 3 cups rotisserie chicken, shredded
- 8 ounces (237ml) pesto, 1 jar
- 2 cups (200g) shredded mozzarella cheese
- 3 tablespoons salted butter
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped

Directions
----------

1. Cut pizza dough into eighths. (Each ball of dough should yield 8 even-sized
   pieces of dough, for a total of 16).
2. Using your hands, roll each piece of dough into a thin strip about
   7 inches (18cm) long. Then carefully tie them into a knot, tucking the
   loose ends of dough underneath.
3. Place each tied knot on a baking sheet or casserole dish with high sides,
   nestling them close together in a 4x4 in (10x10-cm) grid. Once all the
   knots are placed in the dish, cover and let rest for 10 minutes.
4. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
5. Uncover and bake for 12 minutes or until the slider buns are golden brown
   and no doughy grey bits remain.
6. Once the knots are out of the oven, lower the oven temperature to 350°F.
7. Allow the knots to cool, carefully remove them from the baking dish and
   cut the grid horizontally, creating both a top and bottom piece.
   NOTE: It’s helpful to hold the knots together with a towel on top while
   cutting them horizontally, as the motion of the knife might cause some of
   them to pull apart.
8. Return the bottom half of the knot-grid to the original baking dish. Evenly
   layer the bread with cooked chicken, followed by the pesto and mozzarella
   cheese. Place the top half of the garlic knots on top.
9. Mix together melted butter, garlic, and parsley. Brush mixture liberally
   over the top of the knots.
10. Bake at 350°F (180°C) for an additional 10 minutes until the tops of the
    knots are golden brown and cheese is melted.
11. Pull apart for individual sliders.
