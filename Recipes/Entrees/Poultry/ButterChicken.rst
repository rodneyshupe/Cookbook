Ingredients
-----------

Marinade
^^^^^^^^

- 1/2 cup plain yoghurt , full fat
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 2 teaspoon garam masala
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 tablespoon ginger, freshly grated
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 1/2 lb (750 g) boneless skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite size pieces

Curry
^^^^^

- 2 tablespoons (30 g) ghee or butter, OR 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 cup tomato passata (aka tomato puree) (or diced tomatoes pureed with hand blender)
- 1 cup heavy cream (for a lighter version use 3/4 cup light cream + 1/4 cup milk)
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 1/4 teaspoon salt
- cilantro, chopped for garnish (optional)

Directions
----------
1. Combine the Marinade ingredients except for chicken in a blender and puree
   until smooth.  Combine marinade with the chicken in a bowl or ziplock bag.
   Cover and refrigerate overnight, or up to 24 hours (minimum 3 hrs).
2. Heat the ghee (butter or oil) over high heat in a large fry pan. Take the
   chicken out of the Marinade but do not wipe or shake off the marinade from
   the chicken (but don't pour the Marinade left in the bowl into the fry pan).
3. Place chicken in the fry pan and cook for around 3 minutes, or until the
   chicken is white all over (it doesn't really brown because of the Marinade).
4. Add the tomato puree, cream, sugar and salt. Turn down to low and simmer
   for 20 minutes. Do a taste test to see if it needs more salt.
5. Garnish with coriander/cilantro leaves if using. Serve with basmati rice
   and/or `Naan Bread <#basic-flatbread>`__.
