- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons hoisin sauce
- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon apple cider or rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon peanut butter
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 tablespoon grated ginger

Wraps
^^^^^

- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
- lb (450g) ground chicken
- 3 green onions, thinly sliced
- 1 red bell pepper, finely diced
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1 (approx. 227 ml) can sliced water chestnuts, chopped
- 1 head bib, leaf, romaine, or iceberg lettuce
- chopped peanuts

Directions
----------

1. For the sauce, whisk together the soy sauce, hoisin, sesame oil, vinegar,
   peanut butter, honey, ginger, and garlic. Set aside.
2. For the wraps, place a large skillet over medium-high heat and add in the
   sesame oil. Add the ground pork and cook, breaking the pork apart with
   the side of a spoon, until golden and almost cooked through about
   6 minutes.
3. Push the pork to one side of the pan and add in the green onions,
   bell pepper, garlic, and water chestnuts. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes,
   tossing frequently, until lightly golden and tender. Stir the vegetables
   into the pork and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes or until the pork
   is cooked through.
4. Pour the prepared sauce into the pan and toss well to combine and heat
   through.
5. Snap off individual leaves of lettuce and fill with the saucy pork.
   Serve topped with chopped peanuts and some sriracha, if desired.
