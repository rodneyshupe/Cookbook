Ingredients
-----------
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 3 1/2 to 4 pound (1.6kg to 1.8kg) whole chicken, giblets discarded
- Salt and pepper

Directions
----------
1. Adjust oven rack to lowest position, place 12-inch cast-iron skillet on
   rack, and heat oven to 500°F. Meanwhile, combine 1 tablespoon oil,
   rosemary, and garlic in bowl; set aside.
2. With chicken breast side down, use kitchen shears to cut through bones on
   either side of backbone; discard backbone. Flip chicken over, tuck wingtips
   behind back, and press firmly on breastbone to flatten. Pat chicken dry
   with paper towels, then rub with remaining 1 tablespoon oil and season with
   salt and pepper.
3. When oven reaches 500°F, place chicken breast side down in hot
   skillet. Reduce oven temperature to 450°F and roast chicken until
   well browned, about 30 minutes.
4. Using potholders, remove skillet from oven. Being careful of hot skillet
   handle, gently flip chicken breast side up. Brush chicken with oil mixture,
   return skillet to oven, and continue to roast chicken until breast
   registers 160°F and thighs register 175°F, about 10 minutes.
   Transfer chicken to carving board, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and
   let rest for 15 minutes. Carve chicken and serve.
