Stromboli
=========

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 lb `pizza dough <#pizza-dough>`__
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 2 garlic cloves, minced (or 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder)
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan, plus extra for the tops
- 2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley (or 1 teaspoon dried)
- 1 pound thinly sliced meats such as Italian cold cuts, deli ham, or large pepperoni slices*
- 3/4 - 1 pound cheese deli cheese like provolone or mozzarella (about 3 cups shredded or about 16-20 slices)*
- 1 large egg beaten
- 1 tablespoon water

Directions
----------

1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or
   silicone baking mat.
2. Divide dough in half. On a lightly floured work surface using a lightly
   floured rolling pin, roll each half of the dough into a 10x16 inch
   rectangle. Use your hands to square off the edges. If the dough keeps
   shrinking as you try to shape it, cover it lightly and let the dough
   rest for 10 minutes before trying again.
3. Mix melted butter and garlic together. Spread all over each rectangle.
   Sprinkle each with parsley and parmesan.
4. Arrange a layer of sliced meats onto each dough, leaving a 1-inch border
   on the bottom and sides and a 3-inch border on top. This usually is
   about 8-10 slices on each depending on the size and thickness of the
   slices. Add a layer of cheese.
5. Repeat with more meat and cheese until all is used; about 1/2 pound of
   meat and 1/2 pound of cheese per stromboli.
6. Combine egg and water to create an egg wash. Brush all edges with egg
   wash, including a 3-inch gap at the top. Slowly roll each into a tight
   16-inch log, folding in the two ends as you roll. Dust your hands or
   the dough with flour if things become too sticky.
7. Carefully transfer each to lined baking sheets. Pinch or tuck in ends
   to seal if they become unfolded.
8. Brush each stromboli with egg wash and, if desired, optional toppings.
   Using a very sharp knife, cut 3-4 slits into the tops of each, which
   helps steam escape. At this point, you can cover shaped stromboli
   tightly and refrigerate for up to 8 hours.
9. Bake for about 25 minutes or until the crust is golden brown; if you
   have an instant-read thermometer, the center of the stromboli should
   be at least 200oF. If baking both at the same time, rotate pans
   halfway through baking and extend bake time (if needed) by
   2-3 minutes.
10. Remove from the oven and cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes before
    transferring to a cutting board and slicing.
