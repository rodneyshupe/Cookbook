Ingredients
-----------

- 1 lb `pizza dough <#pizza-dough>`__
- 1/2 cup pizza sauce
- 1/2 cup pepperoni
- 1/4 cup salami
- 1 cups shredded mozzarella
- 1/2 cup ricotta cheese
- 1 tablespoon oil
- 1/4 cup parmesan cheese
- 1 egg, beaten
- 1 tablespoon water

Directions
----------

1. Preheat the oven to 475 Â°F. Line the baking sheet with parchment paper
   or spray it with oil.
2. Divide the dough into 4 equally sized pieces. Roll each piece into a
   1/4in thick circle.
3. Place the filling on half of each circle (pizza sauce, ricotta,
   pepperoni, salami and shredded mozzarella). Make sure to leave the edges
   clean to allow for sealing the calzone. Combine egg and water and brush
   edges with egg wash. Fold the side over the filling and crimp the edges.
4. Place calzones on a baking sheet, leaving space apart. Brush top with
   egg wash. Cut a small vent on the top of each calzone. Brush the tops
   with oil and sprinkle with parmesan cheese. Bake for 15 minutes or until
   golden brown.
