Ingredients
-----------
- 4 red, yellow, or orange bell peppers
- 1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 3/4 cup Arborio rice
- 8 ounces (225g) hot Italian sausage, casings removed
- 1	medium onion, chopped fine (about 1 cup)
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
- Salt and pepper
- 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1 can, 14 1/2 ounce (428ml), crushed tomatoes
- 2 1/2 ounces (70g) Parmesan cheese, grated (1 1/4 cups)
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil

Directions
----------
1. Bring 4 quarts water to boil in large stockpot or Dutch oven over high
   heat. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350°F.
2. While water is coming to a boil, cut off top 1/2 inch of bell peppers.
   Discard stem and seeds. Chop pepper tops into 1/4-inch pieces; reserve
   pepper cups. Add 1 tablespoon salt and bell peppers. Cook until peppers
   just begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, remove peppers
   from pot, drain off excess water, and place peppers cut-sides up on
   paper towels.
3. Microwave broth and rice in covered large bowl until liquid is absorbed
   and rice is nearly tender, 10 to 13 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, cook sausage in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high
   heat, breaking up meat into small pieces, until browned, 6 to 8 minutes.
   Using slotted spoon, transfer sausage to paper towel–lined plate.
5. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from skillet. Add onions and chopped
   pepper and cook until browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in garlic, oregano,
   1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/8 teaspoon pepper, and pepper flakes and cook until
   fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes, bring to boil, and simmer for
   15-20 minutes then remove from heat.
6. Combine 1 cup sauce, sausage, and 1 cup Parmesan with parcooked rice.
7. Place peppers cut-side up in 9-inch square baking dish. Using soup spoon,
   divide filling evenly among peppers. Spoon 2 tablespoons remaining sauce
   over each filled pepper and sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon of remaining
   cheese. Bake until cheese is browned and filling is heated through,
   25 to 30 minutes. Serve immediately.
