Directions
----------

1. Toss meat, seafood, or tofu with soy sauce and sherry in medium bowl;
   set aside. Combine all sauce ingredients in a second small bowl.
   Divide vegetables into two or three batches according to ingredient
   list.
2. Heat 12- or 14-inch nonstick skillet over high heat, 4 minutes (pan
   should be so hot, you can hold your outstretched hand 1 inch above
   its surface for no more than 3 seconds); add 1 tablespoon oil (add 2
   tablespoons for tofu or fish) and rotate pan so that bottom is evenly
   coated. Let oil heat until it just starts to shimmer and smoke. Check
   heat with hand. Drain meat, seafood, or tofu, then add to pan and
   stir-fry until seared and about three-quarters cooked (about 20
   seconds for fish, 60 seconds for meat, 2 minutes for tofu, 2 1/2 to 3
   minutes for chicken). Spoon cooked meat or seafood into serving dish.
   Cover and keep warm.
3. Let pan come back up to temperature, 1 or 2 minutes. When hot,
   drizzle in 2 teaspoons of oil, and when oil just starts to smoke, add
   vegetables from first category. Stir-fry until vegetables are just
   tender-crisp, about 2 minutes. Leaving first batch in pan, repeat
   with remaining vegetables, cooking each set of vegetables until
   tender-crisp, or for fourth category, wilted. Add about a teaspoon of
   oil for each new batch (amount of oil will depend on skillet you are
   using-nonstick pans require about a teaspoon; other pans may require
   2 teaspoons). Clear center of pan and add garlic, ginger, and
   scallions. Drizzle with 1/2 teaspoon of oil. Mash into pan with back
   of a spatula. Cook for 10 seconds. Remove pan from heat and stir
   garlic/ginger mixture into vegetables for 20 seconds.
4. Return pan to heat and add cooked meat, seafood, or tofu. Stir in
   sauce and stir-fry to coat all ingredients, about 1 minute. Serve
   immediately with rice.

Note: Stir Fry Fundamentals
---------------------------

*No matter what you’re stir-frying, follow these guidelines to ensure
success.* - Be ready for quick cooking: Prep ingredients in advance. -
For even browning, use a nonstick skillet, not a wok. - Limit stirring
so meat and vegetables can develop color. - Sear in batches so meat
doesn’t steam. - Add aromatics last to preserve flavor and avoid
scorching.
