===================

| Total: 1 1/2 hours, plus 2 hours rising | Yield: Serves 4 |
+-----------------------------------------+-----------------+

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 320g (2 1/4 cups) all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons instant or rapid-rise yeast
- 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar
- 235g (1 cup) room temperature water
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 10 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded (2 1/2 cups)
- 1 cup `pizza sauce <#simple-pizza-sauce>`__ (or `this one <#no-cook-pizza-sauce>`__)

Directions
----------

1. Spray 13 by 9-inch nonstick baking pan with vegetable oil spray, then
   brush bottom and sides of pan with oil. Using stand mixer fitted with
   dough hook, mix flour, yeast, and sugar on low speed until combined,
   about 10 seconds. With mixer running, slowly add room-temperature
   water and mix until dough forms and no dry flour remains, about
   2 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed. Cover with plastic wrap and
   let stand for 10 minutes.
2. Add salt to bowl and knead on medium speed until dough forms satiny,
   sticky ball that clears sides of bowl, 6 to 8 minutes. Turn dough onto
   lightly floured counter and knead until smooth, about 1 minute.
3. Transfer dough to prepared pan, cover with plastic, and let rest for 15
   minutes. Using your well-oiled hands, press dough into corners of pan.
   (If dough resists stretching, let it rest for another 10 minutes before
   trying again to stretch.) Cover with plastic and let dough rise at room
   temperature until nearly tripled in volume and large bubbles form, 2 to
   3 hours. Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 500
   degrees.
4. Sprinkle Monterey Jack evenly over dough to edges of pan. Spoon three
   1-inch-wide strips of sauce, using 1/3 cup sauce for each, over cheese
   evenly down length of pan.
5. Bake until cheese is bubbly and browned, about 15 minutes. Let pizza
   cool in pan on wire rack for 5 minutes. Run knife around edge of pan to
   loosen pizza. Using spatula, slide pizza onto cutting board. Cut into 8
   pieces and serve.

Notes
-----

To add more toppings, such as pepperoni or sausage, to your pizza, press
them into the dough before adding the cheese.
