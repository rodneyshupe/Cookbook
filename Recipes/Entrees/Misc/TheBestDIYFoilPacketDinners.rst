can cook in the oven or on the grill, and there is minimal clean-up afterward.

Ingredients

   in the center of each piece, layering the butter, hamburger and or
   sausage with the vegetables spices, herbs and flavorings of your choice.

Tin foil dinners are one of the easiest dinner recipes you can make, but
there are a few key things to remember when assembling your meals. Here are
the basic steps:

Step 1: Find Your Fat
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
First you must have a fat so the raw ingredients don’t stick to the foil as
it cooks. Oil in most any form (plain or flavored), butter, and bacon fat
are all likely contenders. Pesto because it does double duty with the
inclusion of herbs and garlic to the oil.

Step 2: Add a Protein
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Ground meats like hamburger, ground turkey, or chicken all work well in
foil packs. Fish, shrimp and shellfish do well too because fish doesn’t take
long to cook. Sliced sausages are also an awesome option. Diced tofu is a
great option for veggie lovers.

Step 3: Veg-Out
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Add layers of veggies. Just about any veggie will do so long as you think
about cooking time. You want harder veggies like potatoes or carrots and
sweet potatoes cut into smaller pieces so they cook at the same rate as
larger cut mushrooms, squashes and onions. There really is no limit to the
ideas you can add to. Fresh, frozen, canned…any and all will do.

Step 4: Spice It Up
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Beyond the absolute must of salt and pepper, you can add just about anything.
Fresh or dried herbs such as thyme, rosemary, Basil, oregano. Try spices like
garlic powder, smoked paprika, cumin, chili powder, tumeric, or even cinnamon.
Sauce it up with a sweet BBQ sauce, steak sauce or add a dash of
Worcestershire. Wine, citrus, stock, sambal olek, sriracha, or soy sauce all
add a tasty umami to the dinner.
