Cast Iron Paella
================

A traditional stainless-steel pan would have to sit over high heat for
the last 5 minutes of cooking to develop this crust, which creates a
high risk of the more delicate ingredients overcooking, but the
cast-iron pan, with its high heat retention, naturally created the crust
during the course of cooking the recipe without any extra steps.

Ingredients
-----------

-  12 ounce (340g) extra large shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), peeled and deveined
-  9 garlic cloves, minced
-  3 tablespoons vegetable oil
-  Salt and pepper
-  12 ounce (340g) boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed and halved crosswise
-  8 ounce (225g) Spanish-style chorizo sausage, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
-  1 red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and chopped fine
-  1 onion, chopped fine
-  2 1/4 cups Arborio rice
-  1/2 teaspoon saffron threads
-  1 can, 14.5 ounce (428ml) diced tomatoes, drained
-  2 1/4 cups chicken broth
-  1/4 cup dry white wine
-  12 mussels, scrubbed and debearded
-  1/2 cup frozen peas, thawed
-  Lemon wedges

Directions
----------

1. Toss shrimp with 1 teaspoon garlic and 1 tablespoon oil and season
   with salt and pepper; set aside. Pat chicken dry with paper towels
   and season with salt and pepper. Heat 12-inch cast-iron skillet over
   medium heat for 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon oil and heat until just
   smoking. Brown chicken on all sides, about 6 minutes; transfer to
   bowl.
2. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in now-empty skillet until
   shimmering. Add chorizo, bell pepper, onion, and 1/4 teaspoon salt
   and cook until vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in
   rice, saffron, and remaining garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30
   seconds. Stir in tomatoes and cook until mixture begins to darken and
   thicken slightly, about 3 minutes. Stir in broth and wine, scraping
   up any browned bits, and bring to simmer.
3. Nestle chicken into skillet. Reduce heat to gentle simmer, cover, and
   cook until most of liquid is absorbed and rice is al dente, about 15
   minutes.
4. Insert mussels hinged side down into rice (so they stand upright) and
   scatter shrimp over top. Cover and cook until shrimp are opaque
   throughout and mussels have opened, 6 to 8 minutes.
5. Off heat, discard any mussels that refuse to open. Scatter peas over
   rice, cover, and let sit until heated through, about 5 minutes. Serve
   immediately with lemon wedges.
