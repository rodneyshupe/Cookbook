Ingredients
-----------
- 1 cup spanish rice, divided
- 1 cup chicken broth, divided
- 1/4 cup white wine, divided
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 4 ounce (113g) thinly sliced chorizo
- 1/4 cup frozen peas
- 1/2 cup thinly sliced roasted red pepper

Directions
----------
1. Preheat grill over medium-high heat.
2. Cut 8 sheets of foil about 12-in long. To form each packet, place 2 sheets
   of foil on top of one another and fold the edges along 3 sides of the
   rectangle to form a barrier. Repeat to form 4 packets.
3. To each packet, add 1/4 c. rice, 1/4 chicken broth, 1 tbsp wine. Carefully
   toss the rice. Add a chicken thigh to each packet over the rice, then
   divide chorizo, peas and red pepper between the 4 packets.
4. Fold the foil packets crosswise over the paella mixture to completely
   cover the food. Fold the edges to seal closed.
5. Place packets on hot grill and cook until the chicken is cooked through
   and the rice is tender, about 25 minutes, flipping once halfway through.
   (Alternatively, you can bake in oven at 425Â°F for about 20-25 minutes.)
