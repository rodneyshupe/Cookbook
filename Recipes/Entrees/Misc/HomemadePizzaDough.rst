====================

| Prep Time: 2 hours | Yield: 1 pound |
+--------------------+----------------+

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 cups (11 ounce or 311g) all purpose or bread flour, plus extra for work surface
-  1 teaspoon instant or rapid rise yeast
-  1 teaspoon kosher salt
-  1 tablespoon garlic powder (option)
-  1 teaspoon sugar (optional)
-  2 tablespoons olive oil, plus extra for bowl
-  1 cup warm water

Directions
----------

1. Pulse the flour, yeast, salt, (and if using garlic powder and sugar)
   in a food processor (fitted with dough blade if possible) to combine.
   With the food processor running, pour the oil, then the water through
   the feed tube and process until a rough ball forms, 30 to 40 seconds.
   Let the dough rest in the bowl for 2 minutes, then process for
   30 seconds longer.
2. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead by
   hand to form a smooth, round ball, about 5 minutes, adding additional
   flour as needed to prevent the dough from sticking. Transfer to a
   lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm
   place until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours,
3. Gently deflate the dough with your fist and turn it out onto an
   unfloured work surface. Gently reshape the dough into a ball and
   cover with plastic wrap lightly sprayed with vegetable oil spray. Let
   the dough rest for 15 minutes, but no more than 30 minutes, before
   shaping.
