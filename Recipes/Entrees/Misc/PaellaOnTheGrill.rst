Paella on the Grill
===================

This recipe shortened the outdoor cooking time by using roasted red
peppers and tomato paste (instead of fresh peppers and tomatoes), making
an infused broth with the seasonings, and grilling (rather than searing)
the chicken thighs. This also deliberately places the chicken on the
perimeter of the pan, where it would finish cooking gently after
grilling, and the sausage and seafood in the center, where they were
partially submerged in the liquid so that they cooked through; once the
liquid reduced, the steam kept them warm.

Ingredients
-----------
-  1 1/2 pounds (680g) boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed and halved crosswise
-  Salt and pepper
-  12 ounces (340g) jumbo shrimp (16 to 20 per pound), peeled and deveined
-  6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
-  6 garlic cloves, minced
-  1 3/4 teaspoons hot smoked paprika
-  3 tablespoons tomato paste
-  4 cups chicken broth
-  1 bottle, 8 ounce (236ml) clam juice
-  2/3 cup dry sherry
-  Pinch saffron threads (optional)
-  1 onion, chopped fine
-  1/2 cup jarred roasted red peppers, chopped fine
-  3 cups Arborio rice
-  1 pound (450g) littleneck clams, scrubbed
-  1 pound (450g) Spanish-style chorizo sausage, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
-  1 cup frozen peas, thawed
-  Lemon wedges

Directions
----------

1. Place chicken on large plate and sprinkle both sides with 1 teaspoon
   salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Toss shrimp with 1 tablespoon oil, 1/2
   teaspoon garlic, 1/4 teaspoon paprika, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in bowl
   until evenly coated. Set aside.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in medium saucepan over medium heat until
   shimmering. Add remaining garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until
   garlic sticks to bottom of saucepan and begins to brown, about 1
   minute. Add tomato paste and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons paprika and
   continue to cook, stirring constantly, until dark brown bits form on
   bottom of saucepan, about 1 minute. Add broth, clam juice, sherry,
   and saffron, if using. Increase heat to high and bring to boil.
   Remove saucepan from heat and set aside.
3. Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15
   minutes. Leave all burners on high.
4. Clean and oil cooking grate. Place chicken on grill and cook until
   both sides are lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes total. Return chicken
   to plate. Clean cooking grate.
5. Place roasting pan on grill (turning burners to medium-high if using
   gas) and add remaining 1/4 cup oil. When oil begins to shimmer, add
   onion, red peppers, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring frequently,
   until onion begins to brown, 4 to 7 minutes. Add rice (turning
   burners to medium) and stir until grains are well coated with oil.
6. Arrange chicken around perimeter of pan. Pour broth mixture and any
   accumulated juices from chicken over rice. Smooth rice into even
   layer, making sure nothing sticks to sides of pan and no rice rests
   atop chicken. When liquid reaches gentle simmer, place shrimp in
   center of pan in single layer. Arrange clams in center of pan, evenly
   distributing with shrimp and pushing hinge sides of clams into rice
   slightly so they stand up. Distribute chorizo evenly over surface of
   rice. Cook covered, moving and rotating pan to maintain gentle simmer
   across entire surface of pan, until rice is almost cooked through, 12
   to 18 minutes. (Heat can also be adjusted to maintain simmer.)
7. Sprinkle peas evenly over paella, cover grill, and cook until liquid
   is fully absorbed and rice on bottom of pan sizzles, 5 to 8 minutes.
   Continue to cook, uncovered, checking bottom of pan frequently with
   metal spoon, until uniform golden-brown crust forms, 8 to 15 minutes
   longer. (Rotate and slide pan around grill as necessary to ensure
   even crust formation.) Remove pan from grill, cover with aluminum
   foil, and let stand for 10 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges.
