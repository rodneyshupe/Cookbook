Chicken Scarpariello (Italian Sweet and Sour Chicken With Sausage)
==================================================================

Instructions
------------

- 2 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (6 to 8 thighs; 1.15kg)
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 3 to 4 links sweet or hot Italian sausage (about 1 1/2 pounds; 700g)
- 1 medium onion, thinly sliced (about 6 ounces; 170g)
- 1 large red bell pepper, thinly sliced (about 6 ounces; 170g)
- 2 tablespoons finely minced fresh sage leaves (about 8g)
- 6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 8 hot or sweet pickled cherry peppers, thinly sliced, along with 1/4 cup (60ml) pickling liquid from the jar
- 1 cup (240ml) dry white wine
- 1 cup homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock
- 2 tablespoons sugar

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). 
2. Season chicken generously with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a 4 to
   5-quart straight-sided sauté pan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until
   shimmering. Add chicken, skin side down, and cook without moving it until
   well browned and crisp, about 8 minutes total, lowering heat if it starts
   to smoke excessively. Flip chicken and brown lightly on second side, about
   3 minutes. Transfer chicken to a large plate and set aside.
3. Return the skillet to heat without draining it and add the sausage. Cook
   until well-browned on the first side, about 1 1/2 minutes, reducing the
   heat if it starts smoking. Flip the sausage and cook on the second side
   until browned, about 1 1/2 minutes longer. Remove the pan from heat,
   transfer the sausage to a cutting board, and cut each one into
   3 to 4 slices.
4. Return pan to heat and add onion and pepper and cook, stirring and
   scraping up browned bits with a wooden spoon, until softened and starting
   to brown, about 4 minutes. Add sage and garlic, stir to combine, and cook
   until fragrant, about 1 minute.
5. Add pickled cherry peppers and their liquid, stirring and scraping up
   browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add wine and
   let liquid reduce by half, about 2 minutes. Add chicken stock and stir to
   combine. Return sausage to pan, toss to combine, then nestle chicken
   pieces skin-side-up in the pan, nestling them down into the sauce,
   vegetable, and sausage.
6. Transfer to the oven and cook until chicken is crisp and tender, about
   30 minutes. Serve immediately, spooning sauce, vegetables and sausage
   around chicken pieces.
