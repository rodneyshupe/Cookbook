Slowcooker Jambalaya
====================

Ingredients
-----------
- 1 pound andouille sausage, sliced
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 1 green bell pepper, finely chopped
- 2 stalks celery, thinly sliced
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 2 teaspoons dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite size pieces
- 1 can (28 ounces) diced tomatoes
- 1 cup uncooked long grain rice
- 1 pound large peeled and divined shrimp

Directions
----------

1. Heat a large skillet on medium high, a teaspoon of oil and then the
   sausage and cook 5 minutes or until it starts to brown. Remove from
   skillet and add to slow cooker.
2. In the now empty pan add additional oil if needed and then put in celery,
   onion and green pepper, cook until softened and just until they get some
   color, about 5 minutes.
3. Add garlic and when fragrant (30 seconds), add tomato paste and stir to
   combine and cook for 1 minute. Add Cajun seasoning, cayenne, oragano and
   thyme and stir well to mix through.  Cook for about 2 minutes and then
   remove and add to the slow cooker.
4. Deglase the pan with some of the chicken broth and add liquid to the slow
   cooker along with the rest of the broth.
5. Add diced tomatoes, and chicken to the slow cooker and set to cook for
   7-8 hours on low (3-4 hours on high) stirring occasionally.
   *Note: For a smokier flavour, grill the chicken before adding it to the slow cooker.*
6. With one hour left in the cooking time, stir in the rice.
7. With 15 minutes left, stir in the raw shrimp.
8. Stir it up, and serve.

Variations
----------
- **Seafood Fiesta:** Swap the chicken for a mix of your favorite seafood â€“ think mussels, clams, and crab.
- **Vegetarian Twist:** Skip the meat and load up on veggies like bell peppers, okra, and tomatoes.
