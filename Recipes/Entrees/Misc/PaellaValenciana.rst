Ingredients
-----------

- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 1/4 pounds (600g) chicken leg pieces, rabbit pieces, or a mix
- Salt and pepper
- 1/4 pound (125g) green beans or runner beans, cut into 1 1/2-inch segments
- 1/4 pound (125g) fresh or frozen lima, butter, or fava beans
- A few cloves of garlic, finely minced
- 1 ripe Roma tomatoe, split in half, the cut-side rubbed through the large holes of a box grater, skins discarded
- 1 teaspoons Spanish smoked paprika
- Pinch saffron threads
- 1 cups (around 400g) short grain rice, preferably Bomba (arborio or any other rice will do fine)
- 2.5 cups (1200ml) water
- 2-3 rosemary sprigs
- Lemon wedges for serving

Directions
----------

1. Heat olive oil in a paella or in a large carbon steel or cast iron skillet
   over high heat until shimmering. Reduce heat to medium, add chicken and/or
   rabbit, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally,
   until it is lightly browned on most sides, about 5 minutes.
2. Add the green beans and lima beans. Stir into the chicken. Add garlic and
   immediately stir into the other ingredients to prevent burning. When the
   garlic is aromatic (about 1 minute), push ingredients the side of the pan
   then add tomatoes directly to center. Let the tomatoes cook down a bit,
   then stir them into the other ingredients.
3. Push everything to the sides again and add smoked paprika and saffron
   directly to the center. Bloom the spices by stirring them in the olive oil
   and rendered chicken fat until fragrant, about 30 seconds, then stir
   everything together.
4. Add rice and cook, stirring frequently, until lightly toasted and coated
   in the bloomed spice mixture, about 2 minutes. Add water and rosemary
   sprigs. Use a wooden spoon or spatula to scrape up any browned bits from
   the bottom and stir everything together well, making sure that the rice is
   all submerged.
5. Bring to a simmer and cook without stirring g until the rice is tender
   and the liquid is absorbed (you may need to add more liquid if it gets too
   dry before the rice is fully cooked; just pour it evenly around the top),
   15 to 20 minutes total.
6. If desired, keep cooking until a crispy crust forms on the bottom of the
   rice (test this by scraping some rice off the bottom with a stiff wooden
   spatula). Serve immediately with lemon wedges.
