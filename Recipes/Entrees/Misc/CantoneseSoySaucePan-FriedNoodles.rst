These Cantonese soy sauce pan-fried noodles are so easy to make, with
simple ingredients. Just make sure you have a HOT wok to get that seared
“wok hay” flavor that everyone loves and craves.

Ingredients
-----------

- 3 cups bean sprouts
- 4 scallions
- 4 teaspoons soy sauce
- 2 teaspoon dark soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon shaoxing rice wine
- 1/2 teaspoon white pepper
- 1 lb fresh thin Hong Kong Style Egg Noodles
- 6 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions
----------

1. Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. Rinse the bean sprouts in cold water
   and drain. Julienne the scallions. Mix the soy sauces, sesame oil, salt,
   sugar, wine and white pepper in a small bowl and set aside.
2. Boil the noodles. Fresh noodles should be boiled for about 1 minute. For
   dried noodles, boil for 2 minutes. Rinse in cold water and drain very
   well.
3. Heat the wok over high heat and add a tablespoon of oil to coat the wok
   (you can also use a cast iron or non-stick pan for this). Spread the
   noodles in a thin, even layer on the wok and tilt the wok in a circular
   motion to distribute the oil and crisp the bottom layer of the noodles
   evenly. It should take about 5 minutes for the first side.
4. Flip the noodles over. add another tablespoon of oil around the
   perimeter of the wok, and let the other side crisp up. Don't stress if
   you can't turn the noodles over in one shot. The goal here is just to
   get an even crispness and to dry out the noodles during this cooking
   stage. Set the noodles aside on a plate.
5. Heat the wok over high heat. Add a tablespoon of oil and all of the
   white parts of the scallion to the pan. Cook for about 15 seconds. Next,
   add the noodles to the wok and toss them well, breaking up the noodles
   so they're not all in one big clump. Add the soy sauce mixture and toss
   continuously for a couple minutes. Keep the heat on high.
6. After the noodles are uniformly golden brown, add the bean sprouts and
   toss. Add the rest of the scallions and toss the mixture again for
   another 1 to 2 minutes until you see the bean sprouts just starting to
   turn transparent. You want the sprouts to be cooked but still crunchy.
