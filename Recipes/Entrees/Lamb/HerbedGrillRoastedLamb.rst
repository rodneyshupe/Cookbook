Ingredients
-----------

- `Herb Mustard Rub <#herb-mustard-rub>`__
- 1 2-lb. boneless butterflied leg of lamb

Directions
----------

1. Lay the lamb flat on your work surface (it should be roughly
   rectangular) and trim any visible sinew, but don't trim anything
   that's holding together sections of the leg. Spread about a
   third of the rub on the surface of the lamb meat. Roll up the lamb
   tightly, from one short end to the other, and tie the roast snugly at
   1-inch intervals with kitchen twine. Spread the remaining herb rub all
   over the rolled, tied roast.
2. Heat grill with medium heat and setup for indirect grilling.  It should
   be between 325° and 375°F. Adjust if necessary.  Add roast and grill for
   about 20 minutes, use tongs or a meat fork to turn and rotate
   the roast to help it cook evenly. Turn the roast so the side that was
   farthest from the fire is now closest to it, but keep it on the cool
   side of the grill.
3. Check the roast with an instant-read thermometer to determine when
   it’s done; the middle of the thickest section, should read 125°F for
   medium rare (about 20 minutes after turning the roast). When the lamb
   has reached the desired doneness, use tongs or a meat fork to roll it
   briefly over the hot side of the fire to sear the outside, turning it
   until all sides are seared, about 2 minutes per side. Cover the lamb
   with foil and let it rest for 10 to 15 minutes before carving.
