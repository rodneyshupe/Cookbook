Ingredients
-----------
- 5 lb. boneless leg of lamb
- 1 cup Greek yogurt
- Zest and juice of one lemon
- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tsp oregano, preferably Greek
- Salt and pepper

Directions
----------
1. Lay the lamb flat on a cutting board and trim the visible pockets of
   interior fat, leaving the fat cap on the exterior. Season the lamb well
   with salt and pepper.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together the yogurt, lemon zest and juice,
   olive oil, garlic and oregano. Rub the marinade all over the lamb and
   place lamb in a gallon-sized plastic big. Refrigerate the lamb for at
   least one hour and up to 3 hours.
3. Remove lamb prior to cooking and allow to come to room temperature. Heat
   grill to medium heat. Cook lamb, turning once, until it reaches an
   internal temperature of 125 degrees for medium-rare, about 20 minutes.
4. Allow lamb to rest, loosely tented with foil, for at least twenty minutes
   prior to carving. Slice against the grain into thin slices and serve.
   (Tzatziki sauce, harissa or mint jelly all make nice accompaniments.)
