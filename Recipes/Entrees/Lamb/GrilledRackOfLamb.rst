Ingredients
-----------

-  1 rack lamb separated into individual chops
-  4 cloves garlic, crushed
-  1 teaspoon salt
-  1/4 cup dijon mustard
-  2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
-  3 teaspoons fresh rosemary, chopped
-  2 tablespoons lemon juice
-  2 teaspoons sugar
-  1/3 cup olive oil

Directions
----------

1. Press the garlic into a small bowl, and mash to a paste with the
   salt. Stir in the mustard, vinegar, rosemary, lemon juice and sugar.
   Whisk in oil in a slow, steady stream.
2. Place the individual lamb chops in a heavy duty resealable bag, and
   add the marinade. Refrigerate at least 6 hours, but preferably
   overnight.
3. Preheat barbecue on High. Reduce heat to Medium and lightly brush the
   cooking grids with vegetable or olive oil. Place the lamb chops on
   the grill 2 minutes. Give the lamb a quarter turn on the same side
   (for great grill marks) and cook for another 2 minutes. Flip the lamb
   racks over and repeat. Let rest tented with foil for 5 minutes before
   carving into individual chops.
4. Garnish with sprigs of fresh rosemary and serve.
