Lamb (and onions)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- 1 pound|450 grams boneless lamb shoulder, trimmed and cut into 3 to 4-inch pieces 
- kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 
- 1 teaspoon chili flakes
- 1 lemon
- 2 medium yellow onions, sliced into ½-inch thick pieces (about 12 ounces|340 grams)
- 1 tablespoon whole grain mustard
- 1/2 recipe of `Mustard Sauce <#mustard-sauce>`

Directions
----------

1. Marinate the lamb and onions: Season the lamb all over with salt and
   pepper in a large baking dish. Add half each of the oil, Dijon, garlic,
   vinegar, and chili flakes. Squeeze over half of the lemon and toss
   everything to combine. 
2. In a medium baking dish, toss the onions with the remaining ingredients,
   plus the whole grain mustard, salt, and pepper. Cover both the lamb and
   onions and refrigerate overnight.
3. Grill the lamb and onions: Light a grill. Grill the lamb until charred
   on the outside and cooked to your liking. If grilling inside, you may
   need to finish the lamb in a 400°F oven.
4. Grill the onions until soft and lightly charred, 7 to 8 minutes.
   Transfer the lamb to a cutting board to rest for 10 minutes, then thinly
   slice. 
5. Serve with the mustard sauce and baguette, plus the collard greens and
   rice, if using.
