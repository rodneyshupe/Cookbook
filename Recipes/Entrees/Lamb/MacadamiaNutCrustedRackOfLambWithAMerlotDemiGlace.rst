Directions
----------

Lamb
^^^^
#. Preheat oven to 425°F. Remove the outer papery covering of the garlic.
   Slice off the top of the head so most of the cloves are exposed.
#. Place the garlic heads on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil.
   Roast in the oven for 45 minutes or until the cloves are completely
   soft and begin to caramelize. Let the garlic cool and then squeeze each
   clove out of the head. With a fork mash the garlic into a paste.
#. Place the lamb on a plate. Season the lamb all over. Heat a skillet,
   add 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil. Sear the lamb racks fatty side first.
   Remove from the skillet.
#. Spread the garlic paste on the fatty side of the racks of lamb. Combine
   chopped nuts and bread crumbs and pack onto lamb pressing firmly.
   (Tip: Combine the nuts and bread crumbs in a food processor and chop.)
#. Reduce oven to 375°F. Place lamb on baking sheet and bake in oven for
   approx. 25 minutes or until lamb is rose. Let lamb rest once out of
   oven for 5 minutes. Slice lamb racks and drizzle sauce over top

Merlot demi-glace sauce
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#. Heat a sauce pan (or use the skillet from above) add olive oil, add
   shallots, season, and sear for 2 minutes. Add wine and reduce until
   almost all the liquid is gone. Add the demi-glace and simmer.
#. Just before plating whisk in whole butter and chopped parsley.
