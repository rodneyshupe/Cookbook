Miso Glazed Salmon
==================

Ingredients
-----------

Miso Glaze
^^^^^^^^^^
- 1/4 cup miso paste, white/yellow variety
- 1/4 cup rice vinegar
- 2 tablespoons sweetener of choice: honey, maple syrup or brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
- 2 cloves garlic, minced (or 1 teaspoon garlic powder)
- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger root, grated (or 1 teaspoon ginger powder)

Salmon
^^^^^^
- 1 lb salmon, about 4 filets
- 2 tablespoons prepared miso sauce
- 2 green onions sliced

Directions
----------
1. Liberally mist a baking sheet with oil spray and set aside. 
2. Pat salmon filets dry, then place on the baking sheet skin side down and
   brush each with about two tablespoons miso sauce. Allow them to marinate
   for about 30 minutes.
3. Preheat oven to 425˚ and position a rack to the top spot. Roast salmon in
   the oven on the top rack for about 10 to 15 minutes. 
4. Set oven to broil and finish under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp
   the tops, if you'd like them more well done. (A general rule: Cook for
   about four minutes per 1/2-inch thickness of salmon, or until the
   internal temperatures reaches 125˚ to 130˚ for medium. Add a few more
   minutes if you prefer it well done; subtract a few minutes if you want it
   medium rare.)
5. Alternatively, you can grill salmon. Make sure fish is at room
   temperature. Place salmon on a pre-heated indoor or outdoor grill, skin
   side down. Cook for five to eight minutes, depending on the thickness.
   Use a wide spatula to carefully flip to the other side and cook for
   another four to five minutes, or until it reaches your preferred level
   of doneness. (Note: Salmon should release easily from the grill; if it
   doesn't, wait another one minute or two before flipping.) Keep in mind
   most salmon filets take just about 12 minutes to cook through, so pay
   close attention to avoid overcooking.
6. Transfer to a serving dish, brush each filet with additional miso sauce
   (using a clean brush or fresh spoon) and sprinkle on optional chopped
   scallions, if desired.
