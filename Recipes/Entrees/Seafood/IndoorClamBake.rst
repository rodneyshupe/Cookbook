| Prep Time: 15 minutes | Cooking Time: 20 minutes | Yield: 4-6 servings |
+-----------------------+--------------------------+---------------------+

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 pounds (900g) live spot prawns or 2 dungeness crabs (1 pound each) (or 1 two pound)
-  2 pounds (900g) small littleneck or cherry stone clams, scrubbed
-  2 pounds (900g) mussels, scrubbed and beards removed
-  1 pound (450g) chorizo or kielbasa, sliced into 1/2 inch-thick rounds
-  1 pound (450g) small new or red potatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces
-  4 medium ears corn, silk and all but the last layer of husk removed
-  8 tablespoons (1 stick) salted butter, melted

Directions
----------

1. Place clams and mussels on large piece of cheesecloth and tie ends
   together to secure; set aside. In heavy-bottomed 12-quart stockpot,
   layer sliced kielbasa, sack of clams-mussels, potatoes, corn, and
   prawns and crab on top of one another. Cover with lid and place over
   high heat. Cook until potatoes are tender (paring knife can be
   slipped into and out of potato centers with little resistance), and
   crabs are bright red, 17 to 20 minutes.
2. Remove pot from heat and remove lid (watch out for scalding steam).
   Remove prawns and crab and set aside until cool enough to handle.
   Remove corn from pot and peel off husks; arrange ears on large
   platter. Using slotted spoon, remove potatoes and arrange them on
   platter with corn. Transfer clams and mussels to large bowl and cut
   open cheesecloth with scissors. Using slotted spoon, remove kielbasa
   from pot and arrange on platter with potatoes and corn. Pour
   remaining steaming liquid in pot over clams and mussels. Arrange crab
   parts and prawns on platter. Serve immediately with melted butter.

Variation
---------

Substitute spot prawns and crab with 2 live lobsters (about 1 1/2 pounds
each). Freeze lobsters for 10 to 15 minutes to sedate them (do not over
freeze), before killing. Once cooked, using a kitchen towel to protect
your hand, twist and remove lobster tails, claws, and legs (if desired).

Notes
-----

-  Choose a large, narrow stockpot in which you can easily layer the
   ingredients. The recipe can be cut in half and layered in an 8-quart
   Dutch oven, but it should cook for the same amount of time.
-  Use left overs for `Leftover Seafood Chowder <#leftover-seafood-chowder>`__.
