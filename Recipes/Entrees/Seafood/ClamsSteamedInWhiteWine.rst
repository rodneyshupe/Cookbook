Ingredients
-----------
- 1 1/2 cups dry white wine
- 3 shallots, chopped fine
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 bay leaf
- 4 pounds (1.8kg) littleneck clams, scrubbed
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
- Lemon wedges

Directions
----------
1. Bring wine, shallots, garlic, and bay leaf to simmer in Dutch oven over
   medium heat; continue to simmer to blend flavors, 3 minutes.
2. Increase heat to high. Add clams, cover, and cook, stirring twice, until
   clams open, 4 to 8 minutes. Using slotted spoon, remove clams from
   liquid and transfer to large serving bowl. Once all clams have been
   removed from pot, whisk butter into liquid to make emulsified sauce.
3. Pour sauce over clams, sprinkle with parsley, and serve immediately with
   lemon wedges.

Note
----
For 1-2 servicng reduce clams to 1 pound per person and half the other
ingredients.  Use a sauce pan instead of the dutch oven.
