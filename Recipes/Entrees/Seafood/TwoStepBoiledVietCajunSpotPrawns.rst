Two-Step Boiled Viet-Cajun Spot Prawns
======================================

Ingredients
-----------
- 3/4 cup softened butter to spread
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- 2 tablespoons Cajun Seasoning Blend
- 1 tablespoon black pepper
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 4 slices orange
- 4 slices lemon
- 1/2 cup sliced yellow onion
- 1/2 cup roughly chopped green onion
- 3 pounds seasoned and cooked Cajun Prawns (see below)
- 1 cup reserved prawn boil cooking liquid or water

Directions
----------
1. In a large wok or Dutch oven over medium-high heat, add the butter, garlic,
   Cajun seasoning, pepper, ginger, orange, lemon, and onions. Stirring
   constantly, cook the ingredients until the onions begin to wilt and the
   citrus fruit softens, about 5 minutes.
2. Add the whole boiled prawns along with 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid. Stir to
   coat the crawfish with the sauce and heat through. Add more cooking liquid to
   thin out the sauce and add more spice, if needed.
3. To serve, mound the prawns on a platter or large bowl and pour over the
   sauce.
