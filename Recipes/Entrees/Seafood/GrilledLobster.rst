Grilled Lobster
===============

Instructions
------------

- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter (3/4 stick), melted
- 2 medium cloves garlic, minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)
- 2 live lobsters (each 1 1/2 to 2 pounds)
- 1/4 cup fresh bread crumbs
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves
- Vegetable oil for cooking grate
- Lemon wedges

Directions
----------

1. Turn all burners on grill to high, close lid, and heat until grill is
   very hot, about 15 minutes. Use grill brush to scrape cooking grate
   clean. Leave burners on high.
2. Meanwhile, mix butter and garlic together in small bowl. Split lobsters
   in half lengthwise, according to illustrations below, removing stomach
   sac and intestinal tract. Scoop out green tomalley and place in medium
   bowl. Using back of chef's knife, whack one side of each claw, just to
   make opening (this will help accelerate cooking). Add breadcrumbs,
   parsley, and 2 tablespoons of melted garlic butter to bowl with
   tomalley. Use fork to mix together, breaking up tomalley at same time.
   Season lightly with salt and pepper to taste.
3. Season tail meat with salt and pepper to taste. Brush cut side of
   lobster halves with some of remaining garlic butter. Take lobsters to
   grill on large tray. Lightly dip small wad of paper towels in vegetable
   oil; holding wad with long-handled tongs, wipe cooking grate.
4. Place lobsters on grill flesh side down. Grill, with lid down, for
   2 minutes. Transfer lobsters to tray, turning them shell side down.
   Spoon tomalley mixture evenly into open cavities of all four lobster
   halves. Place lobsters back onto grill, shell-side down. Baste lobsters
   with remaining garlic butter. Grill, covered, until tail meat turns
   opaque creamy white color and tomalley mixture is bubbly and has begun
   to brown on top, 5 to 7 minutes.
5. Serve lobsters immediately with lemon wedges. Use lobster picks to get
   meat from inside claws and knuckles.

Variations
----------

Tarragon-Chive Butter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* In step 2, add 2 teaspoons minced fresh chives and 1 teaspoon minced fresh
  tarragon to garlic butter. Replace parsley in breadcrumb mixture with
  2 tablespoons minced fresh chives and 2 teaspoons minced fresh tarragon
  leaves.

Chili Butter
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* In step 2, add 1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder and 1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon cayenne
  pepper to garlic butter. Serve lobsters with lime wedges rather than lemon
  wedges.

Gin and Tonic Butter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* In step 2, while splitting the lobsters place 2 whole lemons and 2 whole
  limes on grill to heat up. Then instead of garlic add 3 tablespoons each
  of gin and tonic to butter. Skip combining Add breadcrumbs, parsley, butter
  and tomalley. Instead inject butter mixture into the lemons and limes.
* In step 3, brush lobster with olive oil.
* In step 4, instead of basing in butter, breadcrumbs and tomalley mixture,
