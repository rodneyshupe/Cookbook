Ingredients
-----------

- 2 tablespoons sugar
- Salt and pepper
- 1 pound (450g) large shell-on shrimp (26 to 30 per pound), peeled, deveined, and tails removed, shells reserved
- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 onion, chopped fine
- 4 garlic cloves, peeled, halved lengthwise, and sliced thin
- 2 anchovy fillets, rinsed, patted dry, and minced
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 2 cans cannellini beans,  15 ounce (444ml), (1 can drained and rinsed, 1 can left undrained)
- 1 can diced tomatoes, 14.5 ounce (428ml), drained
- 1/4 cup shredded fresh basil
- 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest plus 1 tablespoon juice

Directions
----------

1. Dissolve sugar and 1 tablespoon salt in 1 quart cold water in large
   container. Submerge shrimp in brine, cover, and refrigerate for
   15 minutes. Remove shrimp from brine and pat dry with paper towels.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch skillet over medium heat until
   shimmering. Add shrimp shells and cook, stirring frequently, until they
   begin to turn spotty brown and skillet starts to brown, 5 to 6 minutes.
   Remove skillet from heat and carefully add 1 cup water. When bubbling
   subsides, return skillet to medium heat and simmer gently, stirring
   occasionally, for 5 minutes. Strain mixture through colander set over
   large bowl. Discard shells and reserve liquid (you should have about
   1/4 cup). Wipe skillet clean with paper towels.
3. Heat 2 tablespoons oil, onion, garlic, anchovies, pepper flakes,
   1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in now-empty skillet over
   medium-low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened,
   about 5 minutes. Add 1 can drained beans, 1 can beans and their liquid,
   tomatoes, and shrimp stock and bring to simmer. Simmer, stirring
   occasionally, for 15 minutes.
4. Reduce heat to low, add shrimp, cover, and cook, stirring once during
   cooking, until shrimp are just opaque, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove skillet
   from heat and stir in basil and lemon zest and juice. Season with salt
   and pepper to taste. Transfer to serving dish, drizzle with remaining
   1 tablespoon oil, and serve.
