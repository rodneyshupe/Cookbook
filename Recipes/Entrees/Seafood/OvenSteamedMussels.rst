Oven-Steamed Mussels
====================

Ingredients
-----------

-  1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
-  3 garlic cloves, minced
-  Pinch red pepper flakes
-  1 cup dry white wine
-  3 sprigs fresh thyme
-  2 bay leaves
-  4 pounds (1.8kg) mussels, scrubbed and de-bearded
-  1/4 teaspoon salt
-  2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces
-  2 tablespoons minced fresh flat leaf parsley

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 500°F. Heat oil,
   garlic, and pepper flakes in large roasting pan over medium heat;
   cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add
   wine, thyme sprigs, and bay leaves and bring to boil. Cook until wine
   is slightly reduced, about 1 minute. Add mussels and salt. Cover pan
   tightly with aluminum foil and transfer to oven. Cook until most
   mussels have opened (a few may remain closed), 15 to 18 minutes.
2. Remove pan from oven. Push mussels to sides of pan. Add butter to
   center and whisk until melted. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaves,
   sprinkle parsley over mussels, and toss to combine. Serve
   immediately.
