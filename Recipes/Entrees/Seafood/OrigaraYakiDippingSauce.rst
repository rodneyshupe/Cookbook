   just before the smoke point.  Place butterflied prawns meat-side down.
   Grill for approximately 1 minute to 1 minute 30 seconds, until meat is
   no longer translucent, and lightly browned. Do not overcook. Flip over
   to the shell side. Pour sauce over prawns and reduce, approximately
   30 seconds to 1 minute. Squeeze lemon juice over the prawns.
3. Plate prawns onto a serving dish. Place garnish on top, and spoon extra
   drizzle sauce over prawns and serve.
