Ingredients
-----------

- 1 blood orange, 
- 1 small fennel bulb, sliced thin
- 2 pacific snapper fillets, halved length wise (to create 2 slim pieces)

Directions
----------

1. Preheat your oven to around 400Â°F.  Cut a large square of parchment
   paper.
2. Segment orange (cut top and bottom off then using knife remove skin and
   pith) and place pieces in small bowl.  Once segmented squeeze juice into
   the bowl
3. In the center of the parchment, place some fennel then some of the orange
   segments, then one half of the filet.the fish in the center of the
   parchment.  Add more fennel, orange and then other filet half.  Drizzle
   with olive oil. Season everything with salt and pepper.
4. Bring the two opposite sides of the parchment paper together over the
   fish. Fold the edges down to create a seal. You can crimp the edges for a
   tighter closure. Repeat the folding and crimping process on the remaining
   sides stopping to leave a small opening. Pour in a tablespoon each of
   white wine and juice from the orange.  Finish crimping closed to create a
   sealed packet.  Repeat with second fish fillet.
5. Place the parchment packet(s) on a baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes.
   Carefully transfer the packet to a plate and open it with a knife (steam
   will be released, so be cautious).
6. Serve the fish directly from the parchment paper, enjoying the flavorful
   juices and vegetables cooked alongside.
