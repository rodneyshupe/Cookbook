Ingredients
-----------

- 1/4 cup Cajun or Louisiana Spice
- 1/4 old bay
- 1 tablespoons cayenne-pepper powder
- 2 tablespoons kosher salt
- 1 onion, peeled and halved through root
- 2 celery ribs, cut into 3-inch pieces
- 1 lemon, quartered
- 1 head garlic
- 3 ears corn, shucked and cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 pounds small (2-inch) red potatoes
- 1 12-ounce kielbasi, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 3 pounds live spot prawns shrimp, preferably with shells on

Directions
----------

1. Fill a very large (12-quart) pot with 4 quarts of water set over high
   heat. Cajun and Old bay spices, cayenne, salt, onions and celery. Squeeze
   lemon juice, then add wedges. Break garlic into cloves, and discard
   excess skin, then add unpeeled cloves. Cover the pot, and bring to a
   rolling boil.
2. Lay corn on a baking sheet in a single layer, then place in freezer.
3. Taste the water after it comes to a boil. It should be very heavily
   salted and spiced, with a bright orange foam (when standing near the
   boiling pot causes you to cough, itâ€™s spicy enough).
4. Add potatoes and sausage to the pot, and let the water return to a
   boil. Turn off heat, and allow to soak for 10 minutes or until
   potatoes are barely tender when pierced with a knife. Bring the water
   to a boil, and add prawns. Cook for 3 minutes, then turn off heat, add
   corn and allow to soak for 7 minutes. Drain, and serve immediately
   with `remoulade <#quick-remoulade>`__ (preferably on a newspaper-lined table).
