Fish Tacos
==========

Ingredients
-----------

- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 cup packed cilantro leaves
- Zest from 2 limes
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 cup tequila
- 1 pound tilapia, cod or any white fish fillets
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 8 7-inch round flour tortillas
- `Mexican Crema <#mexican-crema>`__
- Shredded red cabbage
- Lime wedges

Directions
----------

1. Pulse the garlic, cilantro, lime zest, cumin, salt and pepper in a small
   food processor for 20 seconds. Then, with the processor running, add the
   tequila.
2. Place the tilapia fillets into a 1 gallon zip-top bag, add the paste and
   move around to coat each fillet. Work as much air out of the bag as
   possible, seal and aside at room temperature for 20 minutes.
3. Heat an electric non-stick griddle to 375 degrees F. (if not using an
   electric griddle you can do this in a cast iron pan heated over medium
   heat for 10 minutes.)
4. Brush the griddle with the olive oil and cook the fillets 3 minutes per
   side or until just cooked through and opaque. Cut into strips and serve
   in warm tortillas with crema, shredded red cabbage and lime juice.
