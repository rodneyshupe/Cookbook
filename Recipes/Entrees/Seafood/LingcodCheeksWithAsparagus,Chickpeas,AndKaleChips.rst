Lingcod Cheeks with Asparagus, Chickpeas, and Kale Chips
========================================================

Ingredients
-----------
- 1 head of Kale
- 1 cup diced asparagus
- 1 cup chickpeas
- 1/2 cup quartered red radishes
- 1 tablespoon diced shallots
- 2-3 cheeks per person
- olive oil
- butter (optional)

Directions
----------
1. Pre-heat your oven to 300 degrees F. Tear the kale into bite size pieces,
   toss in olive oil, season with sea salt and cracked pepper. Place on a
   baking sheet and bake in the oven until light golden brown and crispy.
2. In a medium-sized fry pan, sauté the shallots, chickpeas, diced asparagus
   and radishes together for a few minutes, until tender but with no extra
   colour.
3. Season the Lingcod cheeks with sea salt and cracked pepper.
4. In a pan over high heat, sauté the cheeks in olive oil for 1 minute per
   side. A little butter thrown in with the oil adds an extra hit of richness
   to the cheeks. Gives the cheeks a little napping (spooning the oil/ butter
   over the fish) while they rest in the pan for a few seconds.
5. Place the veggies on a plate or platter, lay the cheeks on top and arrange
   the kale chips around.
