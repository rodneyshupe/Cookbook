Ingredients
-----------
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 pint cherry tomatoes, halvedSalt and pepper
- 4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 1 can tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon dry Italian seasoning
- 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 1 1/2 cups orzo
- 1 L low sodium chicken or vegetable broth
- 1/2 cup (40 g) finely grated Parmigiano Reggiano
- 1 (540 ml) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed

Directions
----------

1. Place a Dutch oven or a pot paired with a tight-fitting lid over medium
   heat. Add the oil and cherry tomatoes, season with salt and pepper, and
   cook down until jammy, about five to six minutes.
2. Add in the garlic and cook for one minute to soften. Stir through the
   tomato paste, Italian seasoning, crushed red pepper flakes, orzo and
   toast for one to two minutes.
3. Add in the broth, turn up the heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil.
   Once boiling, cover the pot with a lid and cook for eight to 10 minutes,
   stirring occasionally, or until the orzo is tender.
4. Stir through the Parmigiano Reggiano, chickpeas, spinach, and any fresh
   herbs. Season to taste with more salt and pepper, if needed, and serve.
