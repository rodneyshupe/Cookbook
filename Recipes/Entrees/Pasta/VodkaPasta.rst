-----------

- 2 tablespoons, olive oil
- 1/2 red onion, finely diced
- 3 cloves  garlic, minced
- 1 -6 ounce can tomato paste
- 1/4 cup vodka
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- Kosher salt & pepper
- 1 pound rigatoni, penne - whatever you like
- 3/4 cup Parmesan cheese, shredded 
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 cup Panko breadcrumbs
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped curly parsely

Directions
----------

1. Heat oil in a large skillet and add onion, cook until just softening about
   3 minutes - add garlic.
2. Mix until fragrant, about 45 seconds then stir in the tomato paste.
3. Cook, stirring often about 5 minutes then add the vodka.
4. Stir in well, scraping bottom of the pan as you go until it’s mostly gone.
5. Turn down the heat a bit and add the cream, red pepper flakes and paprika,
   stir well until combined, season with salt & pepper, remove from heat and
   set aside.
6. Melt butter in a small pot and add the panko crumbs - cook stirring often
   until golden brown, add the parsley, mix and set aside for garnish.
7. Bring a large pot of salted water, to a boil, and add the pasta - stir
   well so it doesn’t stick.
8. Cook about a minute less than package directions, or until al dente.
9. Drain the pasta, but hang on to one cup of the pasta water and put the
   sauce back onto the heat and add the pasta and 1/2 cup of the Parm.
10. Cook, stirring well to combine, and adding 1/4 of the reserved water at
    a time to get the pasta to your desired creamingness.
11. Serve with more Parmesan and topped with some of the crispy Panko.
