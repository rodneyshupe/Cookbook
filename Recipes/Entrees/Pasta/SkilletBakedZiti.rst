Ingredients
-----------
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 6 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1 can, 28 ounce (828ml), can crushed tomatoes
- 3 cups water
- 12 ounces (340g) ziti (3 3/4 cups) (You can substutue Penne)
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/4 cup minced fresh basil leaves

Directions
----------
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 475°F.
2. Combine oil, garlic, pepper flakes, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in 12-inch,
   ovensafe nonstick skillet and sauté over medium-high heat until fragrant,
   about 1 minute. Add crushed tomatoes, water, ziti, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
   Cover and cook, stirring often and adjusting heat as needed to maintain
   vigorous simmer, until ziti is almost tender, 15 to 18 minutes.
3. Stir in cream, Parmesan, and basil. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
   Sprinkle mozzarella evenly over ziti. Transfer skillet to oven and bake
   until cheese has melted and browned, about 10 minutes. Serve.

If your skillet is not ovensafe, transfer the pasta mixture into a shallow
2-quart casserole dish before sprinkling with the cheese and baking.
