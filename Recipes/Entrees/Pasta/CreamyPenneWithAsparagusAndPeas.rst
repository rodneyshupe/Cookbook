   to paper towel-lined plate.
3. Return water to boil, add pasta, and cook, stirring often, until al

   to pot.
4. Add sauce, asparagus, chives, lemon zest, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4
   teaspoon pepper to pasta and toss to coat. Adjust consistency with
   reserved cooking water as needed and season with salt and pepper to
   taste. Serve with extra Parmesan.
