Ingredients
-----------

- 2 stiploin steaks (10oz/300g each), cooked to medium rare
- 400 grams of linguine
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 onion, diced
- 2 cloves of garlic, crushed
- 200 grams of chestnut mushrooms
- 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, chopped, plus extra to garnish
- Juice of 1‚ÅÑ2 lemon
- 200 millilitres of double cream
- Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions
----------

1. Remove the steaks from the fridge 30 minutes before cooking to allow
   them to come up to room temperature.
2. To make the creamy mushroom sauce, place a frying pan over medium heat
   and add the oil. Then stir in the onion and garlic, and cook for two
   minutes.
3. Add the mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and continue to cook for
   10 minutes, tossing every minute or so.
4. Add the fresh rosemary and lemon juice, and cook for another minute.
   Pour in the cream, stir, reduce the heat to low, and cook for five
   minutes. Keep warm over low heat.
5. Meanwhile, put a large saucepan of salted boiling water over high heat,
   stir in the pasta and cook for 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain,
   reserving a couple of tablespoons of the cooking water.
6. Leave the steaks to rest for about two minutes before serving to allow
   the juices that have been drawn to the surface to relax back into the
   meat.
7. Return the cooked pasta back to the large saucepan over low heat with
   the reserved pasta cooking water and the creamy mushroom sauce. Toss
   together and serve in warmed dishes.
8. Thinly slice the steaks and serve on top of the creamy mushroom
   linguine, scattered with some chopped rosemary and a twist of black
   pepper.

Variations
----------

* Prawns: Substitute 1lb prawns (peeled and deveined) for the steak, add
  them to mushroom mixture with cream to cook.
* Ham/Capicola: Replace mushrooms with 1/2lb ham or capicola, cubed into
  1/2 pieces. Remove steak, but add 1/2 cup peas (thawed from frozen) to
  sauce right before adding pasta.
