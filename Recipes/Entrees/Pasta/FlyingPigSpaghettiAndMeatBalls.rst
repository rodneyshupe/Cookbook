Directions
----------
1. TOMATO SAUCE: Pre heat a large pot on medium heat. Add one fluid ounce
   of olive oil to the pot. Ensure its not too hot or it will burn the oil.
2. Saute the onion until soft and add the carrots. Continue to stir the
   vegetables so they cook evenly. Add celery and continue to saute for two
   more minutes. Add garlic and chili flakes and saute for one minute, then
   deglaze with the wine. Reduce wine by 50 per cent.
3. Add canned tomatoes, basil and parsley and stew for 45 minutes on medium
   heat.
4. MEATBALLS: Preheat oven to 420 degrees. Line a baking tray with
   parchment paper. Mix all the ingredients by hand in a large mixing bowl
   until well mixed.
5. Roll the meatball mix into 3 tablespoon balls and place on the baking
   sheet. Do not crowd the meatballs. Bake the meatballs for 12 minutes.
6. Add honey to the sauce. Puree the mixture using a hand blender or
   blender. Mix the water and cornstarch together, add to your tomato sauce
   and return to the heat for two minutes. This will stop the sauce from
   separating. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
