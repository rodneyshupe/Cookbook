Ingredients
-----------

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, trimmed and sliced
- sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1 garlic clove, peeled and chopped
- 1 leek, quartered and sliced thin
- 1 cup chicken stock (can also use vegetable broth)
- 8 no-boil/oven ready lasagne sheets
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons roughly chopped tarragon leaves

For the garlic bruschette
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- 3-4 slices bread, such as ciabatta, French, or Italian loaf
- olive oil
- 1 garlic clove, peeled and halved

Directions
----------

1. Heat a large frying pan and add a dash of oil. Season the mushrooms with
   salt and pepper and start to saute them, adding the garlic after 2
   minutes and the leek a minute later. Cook for 6-8 minutes until the leek
   is soft and the mushrooms are colored on the outside Taste and adjust
   the seasoning.
2. Add the stock and boil for 5 minutes until reduced by half.
3. Meanwhile, cook the lasagne sheets in a large saucepan of boiling salted
   water for 4 minutes or until just al dente.
4. While the lasagne is cooking, add the cream to the frying pan and simmer
   for 2-3 minutes to reduce a little.
5. When the lasagne sheets are cooked, drain and add to the pan with the
   sauce, stirring until well coated. Turn off the heat, add the tarragon
   leaves, and allow to sit while the bread toasts.
6. To prepare the bruschette: Preheat a grill pan or the broiler. Rub the
   slives of ciabatta with olive oil and the cut side of the garlic clove
   and toast for 1-2 minutes on each side until golden brown.
7. To serve, spoon the lasagne and mushroom mixture onto serving plates.
   Serve the toasted bruschette slices on the side.
