Directions
----------

1. Preheat oven to 425F.

   Break the meat apart as it cooks, and continue until until  the meat
   is beginning to brown and are broken into pieces the size of lentils.
3. Add onion garlic and a large pinch of salt, then stir to combine. As
   the onions begin to release moisture, scrap up any fond beginning to
   form on the bottom of the pan.  Cover and continue to cook for
   5 minutes.  Scrape up the bottom of the pan.
4. Add oregano, chili flakes, and tomato paste.  Stir to combine and
   cook to allow flavours to bloom and cook the tomato paste.  Stir in

5. Add spaghetti and gentle stir to submerge.  Bring to a simmer for
   1 minute to allow the spaghetti to soften and then stir the noodles
   to combine.
6. Add pot uncovered to the oven.  After 5 minutes stir and add back to
   the over for another 5 minutes. Continue to cook for 6-8 minutes more
   until noodles are a little past el dente.  Stir in parmesan and serve.
