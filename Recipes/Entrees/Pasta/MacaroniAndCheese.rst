Macaroni and Cheese
===================

Ingredients
-----------

-  1 1/2 cups water
-  1 cup milk
-  8 ounces (225g) elbow macaroni
-  4 ounces (113g) velveeta, shredded *(to shred put in freezer for 30 min)*
-  1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
-  Small pinch cayenne pepper
-  4 ounces (113g) extra-sharp cheddar cheese, shredded (1 cup)
-  1/3 cup panko bread crumbs
-  1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
-  Salt and pepper
-  2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions
----------

1. Bring water and milk to boil in medium saucepan over high heat. Stir
   in macaroni and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring frequently,
   until macaroni is soft (slightly past al dente), 6 to 8 minutes. Add
   velveeta, mustard, and cayenne and cook, stirring constantly, until
   cheese is completely melted, about 1 minute. Off heat, stir in
   cheddar until evenly distributed but not melted. Cover saucepan and
   let stand for 5 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, combine panko, oil, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon
   pepper in 8-inch nonstick skillet until panko is evenly moistened.
   Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until evenly browned, 3
   to 4 minutes. Off heat, sprinkle Parmesan over panko mixture and stir
   to combine. Transfer panko mixture to small bowl.
3. Stir macaroni until sauce is smooth (sauce may look loose but will
   thicken as it cools). Season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer
   to warm serving dish and sprinkle panko mixture over top. Serve
   immediately.
