Ingredients
-----------

Tomato Sauce
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- 2 28-ounce cans diced tomatoes (in juice)
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 medium cloves garlic, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 1 tablespoon)
- 1/2 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes, optional
- Table salt
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil

Filling and Pasta
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- 3 cups part-skim ricotta cheese
- 4 ounces grated Parmesan cheese (about 2 cups)
- 8 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese (about 2 cups)
- 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
- 1 (10-ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed, squeezed dry, and chopped fine
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
- Pinch ground nutmeg
- 16 Barilla no-boil lasagna noodles

Directions
----------

1. For the sauce Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to
   375 degrees. Pulse 1 can tomatoes with their juice in food processor until
   coarsely chopped, 3 or 4 pulses. Transfer to bowl. Repeat with remaining
   can tomatoes.
2. Heat oil, garlic, and pepper flakes (if using) in large saucepan over
   medium heat until fragrant but not brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in tomatoes
   and 1/2 teaspoon salt and simmer until thickened slightly, about
   15 minutes. Stir in basil; adjust seasoning with salt.
3. For the filling: Combine ricotta, 1 cup Parmesan, mozzarella, eggs,
   spinach, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, basil, and nutmeg in medium
   bowl; set aside.
4. To assemble: Pour 1 inch boiling water into 13 by 9-inch broilersafe
   baking dish, then add noodles one at a time. Let noodles soak until
   pliable, about 5 minutes, separating noodles with tip of sharp knife to
   prevent sticking. Remove noodles from water and place in single layer on
   clean kitchen towels; discard water in baking dish and dry baking dish.
5. Spread bottom of baking dish evenly with 1 1/2 cups sauce. Using
   soupspoon, spread generous 1/4 cup cheese-spinach mixture evenly onto
   bottom three-quarters of each noodle (with short side facing you),
   leaving top quarter of noodle exposed. Roll into tube shape and arrange
   in baking dish seam side down. Top evenly with remaining sauce, making
   certain that pasta is completely covered.
6. Cover manicotti with aluminum foil. Bake until bubbling, about 40 minutes,
   then remove foil. Remove baking dish, adjust oven rack to uppermost
   position (about 6 inches from heating element), and heat broiler. Sprinkle
   manicotti evenly with remaining 1 cup Parmesan. Broil until cheese is
   spotty brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Cool 15 minutes, then serve.

Note
----

The manicotti can be prepared through step 5, covered with a sheet of
parchment paper, wrapped in aluminum foil, and refrigerated for up to 3 days
or frozen for up to 1 month. (If frozen, thaw the manicotti in the
refrigerator for 1 to 2 days.) To bake, remove the parchment, replace the
aluminum foil, and increase baking time to 1 to 1 1/4 hours.
