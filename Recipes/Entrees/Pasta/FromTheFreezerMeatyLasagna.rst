- 1/2 pound (225g) ground beef chuck (85 percent lean)
- 1/2 pound (225g) ground pork
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- 1 can tomato puree, 28 ounces (828ml)
- 1 can diced tomatoes, 28 ounces (828ml)
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil

Ricotta, Mozzarella, and Pasta Layers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- 1 3/4 cups whole-milk ricotta
- 1 1/4 cups Grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
- 2 large eggs, lightly beaten

- 12 no-boil lasagna noodles, from one 8 or 9 ounce (225g or 255g) package

Directions
----------
1. For the sauce: Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium heat until
   shimmering, about 2 minutes. Add onion and cook until softened, about
   2 minutes. Add garlic and pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about
   30 seconds. Increase heat to medium-high, add ground meats, salt, and
   pepper, and cook, breaking meat into small pieces, until meat is no longer
   pink but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add cream and simmer until liquid
   evaporates and only fat remains, about 4 minutes. Stir in tomato puree,
   diced tomatoes, and basil and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to low and
   simmer until flavors blend, about 3 minutes. Remove pot from heat, cool
   sauce for 20 minutes, then refrigerate until cool, at least 20 minutes.
2. For the pasta layers: Mix ricotta, 1 cup Parmesan, basil, eggs, salt, and
   pepper in bowl. Spread 1/4 cup meat sauce over bottom of 13 by 9-inch
   baking dish. Place 3 noodles crosswise on top of sauce, evenly space
   9 tablespoons ricotta mixture over noodles, and sprinkle evenly with
   1 1/4 cups mozzarella; spoon 1 1/2 cups sauce over cheese. Repeat layering
   of noodles, ricotta mixture, mozzarella, and sauce two more times. Place
   3 remaining noodles on top and spread with remaining sauce. Cover with
   remaining 1 1/4 cups mozzarella and remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan.
3. Spray large sheet of aluminum foil with nonstick cooking spray and tightly
   cover lasagna. Wrap with plastic wrap several times and cover with another
   layer of foil. Freeze.
4. When ready to serve: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to
   375 degrees. Remove all wrapping except foil layer that is flush against
   lasagna. Bake 1 hour and 15 minutes, then remove foil. Continue baking
   until cheese is spotty brown and sauce is bubbling, about 30 minutes. Let
   lasagna cool for 15 minutes. Serve.
