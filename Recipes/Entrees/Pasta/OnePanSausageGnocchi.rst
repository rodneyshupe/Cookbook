One Pan Sausage Gnocchi

==================

Ingredients
-----------

- 1/2 lb hot italian sausage (approx. 2 links)
- 1/2 red onion, diced (can substitute yellow onion)
- 1 red pepper, sliced
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 can, 14 ounce (414ml), can crushed tomatoes
- 4 oz (113g) mozzarella, grated
- 1 pkg Gnocchi
- 1/4 - 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh basil leaves

Directions
----------

1. If sausage is in links remove casing.  Divide and roll sausage into
   3/4 inch balls. Add sausage to a pan over medium high heat.  Brown
   meat balls on all sides.
2. Add water to a pot and bring to a boil.
3. Add onions and cook until starting to soften.  Add pepper and cook until
   onion and pepper are almost cooked.  Make space in the pan and add a splash
   of oil and then garlic.  Stir garlic to combine, then add tomato paste and
   stir to combine.  Cook to reduce acidity in the tomato paste, about
   2 minutes. Stir in mozzarella.
4. Add gnocchi to pot and as pieces begin to float add gnocchi to pan and stir
   into the sauce.  Top pan with Parmesan and place under the oven broiler 
   until beginning to brown, 3-4 minutes. Remove from oven and sprinkle with
   basil and serve.
