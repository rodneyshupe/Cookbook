- 4 ounces (113g) Pecorino Romano cheese, grated (2 cups) (Can substitute Parmesan)

Directions
----------

1. **For the Lasagna**: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to
   375Â°F. Spray rimmed baking sheet and 13 by 9-inch baking dish with
   oil spray. Bring 4 quarts water to boil in large Dutch oven. Add noodles
   and salt and cook, stirring often, until al dente. Drain noodles and
   transfer them to prepared sheet. Using tongs, gently turn noodles to coat
   lightly with oil spray. Cut 2 noodles in half crosswise.
2. **For the Meat Sauce**: Mash bread and milk in bowl until smooth. Add beef,
   salt, and pepper and knead with your hands until well combined; set aside.
   Heat oil in now-empty Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add
   onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, oregano,
   and pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
3. Add beef mixture, breaking meat into small pieces with wooden spoon, and
   cook until no longer pink, about 4 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and bring to
   simmer, scraping up any browned bits. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer
   until flavors have melded, about 5 minutes.
4. **For the Cream Sauce**: Whisk all ingredients in bowl until combined.
5. Lay 3 noodles lengthwise in prepared dish with ends touching 1 short side
   of dish, leaving gap at far end. Lay 1 half noodle crosswise to fill gap
   (if needed).
6. Spread 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over noodles, followed by 1/2 cup cream sauce
   and finally 1/2 cup mozzarella. Repeat layering of noodles, meat sauce,
   cream sauce, and mozzarella 3 more times, switching position of half
   noodle to opposite end of dish each time.
7. Lay remaining 3 noodles over top (there is no half noodle for top layer).
   Spread remaining cream sauce over noodles, followed by remaining
   1 cup mozzarella. Sprinkle Pecorino over top.
8. Spray sheet of aluminum foil with oil spray and cover lasagna. Set lasagna
   on rimmed baking sheet. Bake for 30 minutes. Discard foil and continue to
   bake until top layer of lasagna is spotty brown, 25 to 30 minutes longer.
   Let lasagna cool for 30 minutes. Slice and serve.

Notes
-----
* **Premade meat sauce:** Instead of making meat sauce you can substitute
  6 cups premade `Bolognese Sauce <#bolognese_sauce>`__.
* **To Make Ahead/Freeze:** At end of step 7, cover dish with greased
  aluminum foil and refrigerate for up to 24 hours or place in freezer. If
  freezing take out of freeze a day ahead and let thaw in the regrigerator.
  When ready to eat, bake lasagna as directed in step 8, increasing covered
  baking time to 55 minutes.
