Pasta all'Assassina, aka assassin's spaghetti, is a popular cult recipe
from Bari in Puglia which is simply dried spaghetti cooked in a tomato
passata (puree) broth using a method known as ‘risottata'. The result is
slightly burnt, crispy caramalized spaghetti with an intense spicy tomato
flavour. One to try!

Ingredients
-----------

- 12 oz spaghetti 
- 14 oz tomato passata (tomato puree)
- 1-2 tbsp tomato paste
- 1/4 cuo extra virgin olive oil. 
- 2-3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 1/2 teaspoons red chili flakes
- 1-2 teaspoons sugar (optional)
- salt and pepper (to taste)
- 2 tablespoons fresh basil, chopped (optional)

Directions
----------

1. Prepare a broth made with water, 2/3 of the tomato passata/purée (1:1),
   and the tomato paste and salt, and bring to a boil and simmer. You want
   the broth to be a bright red and tasty, but still a broth. This broth
   needs to be hot when you add it to the spaghetti, otherwise you will
   lower the cooking temperature for the pasta.
2. In a cast iron pan, add olive oil, garlic, red chili flakes.  Heat until
   fregrant and pour in the 1/3 of undiluted tomato passata/purée. To
   temper the acidity from the tomatoes, you can add 1 teaspoon sugar.
3. Spread the passata over the whole pan with a wooden spoon and let it
   reduce and thicken slightly. At this point put the uncooked spaghetti in
   the pan, distributing the pasta a way that it lies on top of the sauce.
   The passata will spit when first poured into the pan so take care not
   to get burnt
4. Wait for the underside of the spaghetti to start caramelizing before
   turning it over. This must be done carefully, a little at a time using a
   spatula. Let the otherside of the spaghetti start to crisp a little and
   then pour in a ladle of the hot tomato broth. It's better not to pour it
   over the spaghetti but to add it to the sides of the pan.
5. At this point the spaghetti should start to soften enough that you can
   move and stir it gently with a wooden spoon. Move any pasta strands that
   might have stuck to the bottom of the pan and allow the tomato broth to
   spread. Once the tomato broth has reduced and the spaghetti starts to
   stick a little again add more broth.
6. Keep repeating this step (adding tomato broth and stirring the
   spaghetti) until the spaghetti is coated in the sauce and cooked. If you
   run out of tomato broth, you can add a little water. Note when finished,
   this dish is relatively dry and crispy, not saucy.
7. If using basil stir in and serve topped with parmasean.
