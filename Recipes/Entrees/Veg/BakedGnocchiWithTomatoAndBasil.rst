Ingredients
-----------
- 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 1 pound (450g) vacuum-packet gnocchi (see note)
- 1 onion, chopped fine
- 6 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1 can crushed tomatoes, 28 ounce (828ml)
- 1 cup water
- 1/2 cup chopped fresh basil
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 475 degrees.
   Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large ovensafe nonstick skillet over medium-high
   heat until shimmering. Cook gnocchi, stirring occasionally, until lightly
   browned, about 4 minutes; transfer to plate.
2. Add remaining oil and onion to empty skillet and cook until onion is
   softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in garlic and pepper flakes and cook until
   fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in tomatoes and water and cook until
   slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.
3. Add basil and browned gnocchi to pan. Reduce heat to low and simmer,
   stirring occasionally, until gnocchi is tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Sprinkle
   with mozzarella and bake until cheese is well browned, about 8 minutes.
   Serve.

Note
----
If you do not have an ovensafe skillet, in step 3 transfer the gnocchi to a
casserole dish for baking.
