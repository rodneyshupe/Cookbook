Insanely delicious, 30-minute red lentil curry! Saucy, hearty, and protein-
rich. Perfect over brown rice for a simple, plant-based meal.

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 Tbsp coconut oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced (3 cloves yield ~1 1/2 Tbsp)
- 1 tsp minced ginger
- 1/2 cup diced carrots
- 3 Tbsp red curry paste
- 1 6-ounce can tomato paste (a 6-ounce can yields ~1/2 cup)
- 2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth (DIY or store-bought)
- 1 cup water
- 2/3 cup dry red lentils (thoroughly rinsed in cold water + drained)
- 1-2 Tbsp coconut sugar (or maple syrup)
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric (plus more to taste)
- 1/3 cup light coconut milk (optional)
- Cooked brown rice
- Pita or naan (omit if gluten free / check for vegan friendliness)
- Pickled red onion*
- Fresh chopped cilantro

Directions
----------

1. Thoroughly rinse lentils in a fine mesh strainer and set aside. If
   serving with brown rice, cook at this time using this method from
   Saveur.
2. Heat a large rimmed skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add coconut oil,
   garlic, ginger, and carrots. Sauté for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
3. Add curry paste and sauté for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
4. Add tomato paste, vegetable broth, water and stir to combine. Then add
   lentils, coconut sugar, turmeric, and stir.
5. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce heat slightly to low (or
   medium-low), and gently simmer for 20 minutes, or until lentils are
   tender. Stir frequently to incorporate flavors, and add more vegetable
   broth as needed if the mixture becomes too thick.
6. An optional (but recommended) step: stir in coconut milk for additional
   creaminess, and to balance the heat of the curry paste.
7. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more turmeric for depth of
   flavor, coconut sugar for sweetness/flavor balance, or a pinch of salt
   for saltiness.
8. To serve, divide brown rice and lentils between 2-3 serving bowls and
   garnish with cilantro, pickled onions, and pita or naan for (optional).
9. Store leftovers separately in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Reheat
   on the stovetop, adding water as needed for moisture, or in the
   microwave.
