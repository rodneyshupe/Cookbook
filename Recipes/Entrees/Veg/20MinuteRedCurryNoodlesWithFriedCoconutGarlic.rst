Ingredients
-----------

- 8 ounces rice noodles
- 4 tablespoons sesame oil
- 6-8 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 3 tablespoons finely shredded coconut
- flacky salt
- 2 cups chopped zucchini or summer squash diced
- 1 tablespoon fresh grated ginger
- 2-3 tablespoons Thai red curry paste
- 1 (14 ounce) can full fat coconut milk
- 1 tablespoon low sodium soy sauce or tamari
- 2 teaspoons agave syrup (honey can be used but not vegan friendly)
- juice from 1 lime
- 1/2 cup fresh basil or cilantro, roughly chopped
- fresno peppers, for serving

Directions
----------

1. Cook rice noodles according to packaged directions.
2. Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic
   and cook until golden, about 3 minutes. Stir in the coconut and cook until
   the garlic is crisp and the coconut is toasted, about 2 minutes. Spoon the
   mix out of the skillet and drain onto a paper towel, season with salt.
3. Return the skillet to medium heat. Add the zucchini and cook 2-3
   minutes until softened. Stir in the curry paste and ginger and cook
   until fragrant, about 1 minute.
4. Pour in the coconut milk, 1/3 cup water, soy sauce, and honey. Stir to
   combine, bring the mixture to a boil, cook 5 minutes or until the sauce
   thickens slightly. If the sauce thickens too much, add additional water to
   thin. Remove from the heat and stir in the lime juice and basil.
5. To serve, divide the noodles and sauce between bowls. Top with peppers,
   fresh basil, and the fried garlic.
