Ingredients
-----------
- 500 gram package of gnocchi
- 1 small red onion, cut into thin strips
- 1 zucchini, chopped into large chunks or strips
- 1 cup coloured pepper, diced
- 1/2 cup asparagus, cut into small spears
- 1/3 cup sun-dried tomatoes, chopped
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1 teaspoon oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon basil
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- Salt and Fresh Ground Pepper to taste

Directions
----------
1. Preheat oven to 450F. In a large bowl, combine gnocchi, chopped red onion,
   zucchini, peppers, asparagus and sundried tomatoes. Add olive oil and
   oregano, basil and red pepper flakes.
2. Stir veggies and gnocchi in oil and spices until completely coated
   However, you may need to add more oil or herbs if youâ€™re using more
   veggies.
3. On a parchment-lined baking sheet, spread out veggies and gnocchi evenly
   so they are not overlapping.
4. Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, turning once halfway through to prevent
   burning. We are looking for a golden crisp coating on the gnocchi and
   caramelized veggies.
5. Allow to cool and then garnish with fresh herbs and crumbled feta!
