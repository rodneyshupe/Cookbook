Dal Makhani
===========

Ingredients
-----------

- 3/4 cup dried red lentils (masoor dal)
- 1/4 cup dried kidney beans (rajma)
- 2 tablespoons butter or ghee
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 inch ginger, grated
- 1 medium onion, finely diced
- 2 medium tomatoes, finely chopped or blended into a paste
- 1 teaspoon red chili powder
- 2 teaspoons garam masala
- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/4 teaspoon turmeric
- 1 1/2 cups water (or vegetable broth for extra flavor)
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream (optional)
- Salt to taste
- Fresh cilantro, chopped, for garnish (optional)

Instructions
------------

1. Rinse the red lentils and kidney beans thoroughly. You can soak them for
   a few hours or overnight for faster cooking, but it's not essential with
   red lentils.
2. In a pressure cooker or Instant Pot, heat the butter or ghee over medium
   heat. Add the garlic, ginger, and diced onion. Saut√© until the onion
   becomes translucent, about 5 minutes.
3. Stir in the red chili powder, garam masala, coriander, cumin, and
   turmeric. Cook for another minute, allowing the spices to release their
   fragrance.
4. Add the chopped tomatoes (or tomato puree) and cook for 2-3 minutes,
   until the tomatoes soften and become slightly caramelized.
5. Add the rinsed red lentils and kidney beans, along with the water (or
   vegetable broth). Season with salt to taste.
6. Close the Instant Pot lid and cook on high pressure for 5 minutes. Let
   the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes, then release any
   remaining pressure manually.
7. Once the pressure is released, open the pot and check the lentils and
   kidney beans. They should be tender but not mushy. If they need further
   cooking, simmer on the stovetop for a few more minutes.
8. *(Optional)* For a richer texture, you can mash a portion of the dal
   against the side of the pot with a spoon. Alternatively, use an
   immersion blender to partially puree a small amount of the dal.
9. Stir in the heavy cream, if using, and adjust the salt to taste.
10. Serve hot, garnished with chopped fresh cilantro (optional).

Tips
----

- You can adjust the amount of red chili powder for your desired level of
  spice.
- To make this recipe vegan, omit the butter or ghee and use coconut milk
  instead of heavy cream.
- Leftovers of Dal Makhani taste even better the next day, as the flavors
  develop further. So make a big batch and enjoy throughout the week!
