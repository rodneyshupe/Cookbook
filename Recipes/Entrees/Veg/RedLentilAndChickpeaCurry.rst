Ingredients
-----------

- 1 cup uncooked red lentils (or 1 3/4 cup cooked, can be bought canned)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 medium sweet onion, diced (I like red, but can use yellow or white)
- 3-4 medium garlic cloves, minced
- 2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger (can buy this fresh or often can be found in squeeze tubes or bottles in the produce section)
- 2 tablespoons red curry paste (can find this in the ethnic food aisle)
- 1 tablespoon curry powder
- 1/2 teaspoon ground tumeric
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- 1 teaspoon sugar (optional, can also use honey, agave, maple syrup)
- 1 1/2 cups crushed tomatoes (I like POM brand in a box)
- 1 14 ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed (I usually rinse these in a small colander)
- Cooked grain (quinoa, farro, black rice, brown rice) or cauliflower rice
- Chopped fresh cilantro for garnish
- **Optional 2 cups fresh baby spinach leaves, sweet potato (orange or purple, cut into squares, and roasted for 30 minutes in oven)**


Directions
----------

1. Rinse lentils, place in a small to medium saucepan, cover with 2.5-3 cups
   of water. Bring to boil over medium to high heat, then reduce heat to low
   to medium, cover, and simmer for 10-15 minutes until tender. Drain excess
   water.
2. If adding sweet potato, cut into bite size squares and cook on baking
   sheet with nonstick foil or parchment paper at 350 degrees for 25 minutes.
3. In a large skillet, heat oil over medium heat (you can omit oil and saute
   in nonstick pan, adding water if needed to prevent sticking), add onion
   and saute 3-5 minutes until soft and translucent. Add garlic and cook for
   1 minute, then add ginger and cook another 1-2 minutes, stirring
   frequently to prevent small pieces from burning.
4. Stir in curry paste, curry powder, turmeric, cumin, salt, and sugar (I
   get these ready in a small dish at the start so they are easy to add).
   Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently for 1-2 minutes.
5. Stir in tomatoes, chickpeas, and cooked red lentils. Reduce heat and
   simmer until heated through.
6. Add sweet potatoes and 2 cups of spinach if using. Mix in until spinach
   is wilted.
7. Serve over a grain or cauliflower rice and top with cilantro.
