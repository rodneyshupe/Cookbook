Ingredients
-----------

Ribs
^^^^
- 2 (2 1/2 to 3 pound) racks St. Louis-style spareribs, trimmed, membrane removed, and each rack cut into 2-rib sections
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon pepper

Vinaigrette
^^^^^^^^^^^
- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice

Directions
----------

1. For the ribs: Pat ribs dry with paper towels. Rub evenly on both sides
   with salt and place on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Let stand
   at room temperature for 1 hour.
2. For the vinaigrette: Combine oil, garlic, and rosemary in small bowl and
   microwave until fragrant and just starting to bubble, about 30 seconds.
   Stir in lemon juice and set aside.
3. Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about
   15 minutes. Turn all burners to medium-high.
4. Clean and oil cooking grate. Brush meat side of ribs with oil and
   sprinkle with pepper. Place ribs meat side down on grill. Cover and cook
   until meat side begins to develop spotty browning and light but defined
   grill marks, 4 to 6 minutes. Flip ribs and cook, covered, until second
   side is lightly browned, 4 to 6 minutes, moving ribs as needed to ensure
   even browning. Flip again and cook, covered, until meat side is deeply
   browned with slight charring and thick ends of ribs register
   175 to 185 degrees, 4 to 6 minutes.
5. Transfer ribs to cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes. Cut ribs
   between bones and serve, passing vinaigrette separately.
