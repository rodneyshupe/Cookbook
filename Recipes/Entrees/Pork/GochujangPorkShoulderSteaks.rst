Gochujang Pork Shoulder Steaks
==============================

The centerpiece of Korean barbecue is the meat, but it doesn’t have to
be steak; Seattle chef Rachel Yang recommends grilling pork shoulder.
Keep an eye on the edge of the meat where it touches the grill: When
it’s browned, turn the pork over.

Serves 4

Ingredients
-----------

-  8 garlic cloves, peeled, crushed
-  1 2" piece ginger, peeled, sliced
-  1/2 cup dry sake
-  1/2 cup gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)
-  1/2 cup mirin (sweet Japanese rice wine)
-  1/4 cup vegetable oil, plus more for grilling
-  1 1/2 pound (680g) skinless, boneless pork shoulder (Boston butt), sliced 3/4" thick

Directions
----------

1. Puree garlic, ginger, sake, gochujang, mirin, and 1/4 cup oil in a
   blender. Set 1/4 cup marinade aside; chill. Transfer remaining
   marinade to a large dish. Add pork; turn to coat. Chill, turning
   occasionally, at least 2 hours. Can be marinated 1 day ahead. Keep
   chilled.
2. Prepare grill for medium-high heat; oil grate. Remove pork from
   marinade and grill, basting with reserved marinade, turning
   occasionally, and moving pork to a cooler area if flare-up occurs,
   until cooked to desired doneness, 8–10 minutes for medium-rare.
3. Transfer pork to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes before thinly
   slicing against the grain.
