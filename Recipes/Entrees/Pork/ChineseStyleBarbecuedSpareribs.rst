Ingredients
-----------

-  1 (6-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and sliced thin
-  8 garlic cloves, peeled
-  1 cup honey
-  3/4 cup hoisin sauce
-  3/4 cup soy sauce
-  1/2 cup Chinese rice wine or dry sherry
-  2 teaspoons five-spice powder
-  1 teaspoon red food coloring (optional)
-  1 teaspoon ground white pepper
-  2 racks St. Louis-style spareribs, 2 1/2 to 3 pound (1.1 to 1.4 kg), cut into individual ribs
-  2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil

Directions
----------

1. Pulse ginger and garlic in food processor until finely chopped, 10 to
   12 pulses, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Transfer
   ginger-garlic mixture to Dutch oven. Add honey; hoisin; soy sauce;
   1/2 cup water; rice wine; five-spice powder; food coloring, if using;
   and pepper and whisk until combined. Add ribs and stir to coat (ribs
   will not be fully submerged). Bring to simmer over high heat, then
   reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 1 1/4 hours, stirring
   occasionally.
2. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425°F.
   Using tongs, transfer ribs to large bowl. Strain braising liquid
   through fine-mesh strainer set over large container, pressing on
   solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard solids. Let
   cooking liquid settle for 10 minutes. Using wide, shallow spoon, skim
   fat from surface and discard.
3. Return braising liquid to pot and add sesame oil. Bring to boil over
   high heat and cook until syrupy and reduced to 2 1/2 cups, 16 to 20
   minutes.
4. Set wire rack in aluminum foil–lined rimmed baking sheet and pour 1/2
   cup water into sheet. Transfer half of ribs to pot with braising
   liquid and toss to coat. Arrange ribs, bone sides up, on prepared
   rack, letting excess glaze drip off. Roast until edges of ribs start
   to caramelize, 5 to 7 minutes. Flip ribs and continue to roast until
   second side starts to caramelize, 5 to 7 minutes longer. Transfer
   ribs to serving platter; repeat process with remaining ribs. Serve.

Make Ahead
----------

At end of step 3, refrigerate ribs and glaze separately, covered, for up
to 2 days. When ready to serve, bring glaze and half of ribs to simmer
in Dutch oven over medium heat, then proceed with step 4. Repeat with
remaining ribs.

Notes
-----

It’s not necessary to remove the membrane on the bone side of the ribs.
These ribs are chewier than American-style ribs; if you prefer them more
tender, cook them for an additional 15 minutes in step 1. Adding water
to the baking sheet during roasting helps prevent smoking. Serve the
ribs alone as an appetizer or with vegetables and rice as a main course.
You can serve the first batch immediately or tent them with foil to keep
them warm.
