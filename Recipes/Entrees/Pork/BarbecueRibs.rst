Barbecue Ribs
=============

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 racks pork ribs (I prefer to use side ribs)
-  1 cup `Basic Barbecue Rub <#basic-barbecue-rub>`__
-  1 cup `Kansas City Style Sweet and Smoky Barbecue Sauce <#kansas-city-style-sweet-and-smoky-barbecue-sauce>`__
-  2 cups wood chips, preferably apple wood, soaked in 2 cups apple
   cider for 1 hour then drained

Directions
----------

1. Remove the papery skin on the back of each rack of ribs by pulling it
   off in a sheet with your fingers or a pair of pliers.
2. Sprinkle the ribs on both sides with two thirds of the rub patting it
   in with your fingers. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 -
   4 hours.
3. Set up the grill for indirect grilling. If using a charcoal grill,
   toss the wood chips on the coals. If using a gas grill, place the
   chips in a smoker box. Don’t grill until you see smoke.
4. Place the ribs in the center of the grill away from the fire.
   Indirect Grill for about 1 hour. The temperature should be around
   325°F.
5. Brush ribs with half of the cup of Barbecue sauce. (Set aside the
   other half for serving on the side at the table.)
6. Increase the heat and continue indirect grilling until the ribs are
   done 15-30 minutes. When done the meat will be very tender and will
   have pulled back from the ends of the bones.
7. Transfer the ribs to a platter. Sprinkle with the remaining rub and
   serve with the other half cup of barbecue sauce.
