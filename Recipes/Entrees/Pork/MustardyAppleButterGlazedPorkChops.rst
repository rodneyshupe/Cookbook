Ingredients
-----------
- 3 tablespoons apple butter
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon soy sauce
- 1/2 teaspoon cider vinegar
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 4 boneless pork chops 3/4 to 1 inch thick, 6 to 8 ounce (170g to 225g), trimmed
- 2 teaspoons minced fresh parsley

Directions
----------
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 275 degrees. Line
   rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and set wire rack in sheet. Spray
   rack with vegetable oil spray. Stir apple butter, maple syrup, mustard,
   soy sauce, and vinegar together in small bowl.
2. Sprinkle salt evenly over both sides of chops. Place chops on prepared
   wire rack and brush 1 teaspoon glaze on top and sides of each chop. Roast
   until meat registers 135 to 137 degrees, 40 to 45 minutes.
3. Remove sheet from oven and heat broiler. Brush 1 tablespoon glaze on top
   and sides of each chop. Return sheet to oven and broil until glaze is
   bubbly and slightly charred in spots, 3 to 6 minutes. Let rest for
   5 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.
