Ingredients
-----------

Rub
^^^

- 5 tablespoons dark brown sugar (2 1/4 ounces; 65g)
- 1 tablespoon (about 9g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt use half as much by volume or the same weight
- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/2 teaspoon ground fennel seed
- Large pinch cayenne pepper

Sauce
^^^^^

- 1 cup ketchup (8 ounces; about 225g)
- 1/2 cup dark molasses (4 ounces; about 115g)
- 1/2 cup (120ml) cider vinegar, divided
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon (15ml) high-quality liquid smoke, such as Wright's (see Note)
- 1 tablespoon (15ml) brown mustard
- 2 teaspoons (10ml) hot sauce

Pork
^^^^

- 1 boneless pork butt, about 5 pounds (2.3kg), cut in half horizontally (see step by step below)
- 1 tablespoon (15ml) vegetable oil
- 1 large onion, finely minced (about 6 ounces; 170g)
- 1 cup (240ml) bourbon
- 1/2 cup (120ml) homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock or water

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack to lower position and preheat oven to 300°F (150°C).
   Combine rub ingredients in a small bowl and mix. Season pork with
   2 to 3 tablespoons rub mixture, making sure to rub it on all sides.
   Reserve remaining rub mixture.
2. Whisk together sauce ingredients in a medium bowl. Whisk in remaining
   spice mixture. Set aside.
3. Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add pork
   and cook, turning occasionally, until well browned on all sides, about
   5 minutes total. (Pork will brown fast because of the sugar. Do not let
   it burn.) Add onion and cook, stirring and scraping up browned bits from
   the bottom of the pan, until softened, about 2 minutes.
4. Turn off burner and add bourbon. Relight burner. Carefully ignite the
   bourbon with a long match or lighter. (Stand back and make sure there is
   nothing flammable above it; it will produce tall flames.) Let cook until
   flames die out, about 2 minutes.
5. Make sure pork is oriented fat side up. Add half of sauce and chicken
   stock or water. Cover Dutch oven, transfer to oven, and cook until pork
   is just starting to turn tender, about 4 hours. Remove lid and continue
   cooking until a knife or fork shows very little resistance when twisted
   inside the meat and a dark bark has formed, about 1 hour longer.
6. Transfer pork to a large bowl, reserving liquid in pot. Using a ladle,
   skim off excess fat and discard. Add reserved sauce and remaining vinegar
   to pot and whisk to combine. When pork is cool enough to handle, shred
   with two forks.
7. Transfer shredded pork to pot and toss with sauce. (If making ahead to
   serve over the course of several meals, store pork and sauce separately,
   adding sauce only to the portion you are serving immediately.) Season to
   taste with more salt, sugar, liquid smoke, or cider vinegar. Serve.

Notes
-----

- Use a high-quality liquid smoke, with no ingredients other than water and
  smoke. Avoid brands with molasses or vinegar, as these can affect flavor.
- For a stronger smoke flavor, combine 2 tablespoons (30ml) liquid smoke and
  3/4 cup kosher salt (7 1/2 ounces; 210g) with 1 gallon (3.75L) cold water.
  Submerge uncooked pork and let rest in refrigerator for at least 1 hour and
  up to 8.
