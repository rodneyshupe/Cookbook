Ingredients
-----------

- 2 lb pork belly or pork shoulder cut into 1-inch cubes
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 8 garlic cloves, chopped
- 1/2 cup chicken stock
- 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
- 2 tablespoons dark soy sauce (dark in color no sweetness)

- 2 tablespoons shaoxing wine (substitute dry sherry or sake)
- pinch Chinese 5 spice (optional)
- 2 cups water

Directions
----------

1. Heat a large thick bottom pot or dutch oven over high heat; add pork
   belly and cook them until nice golden brown edges, about 20 minutes.
2. Add onion and garlic into the pork, cook all together about 2 to 3
   minutes stirring frequently.
3. Mix chicken stock, oyster sauce, hoisin sauce, dark soy sauce, honey and
   shaoxing wine in a measuring cup or mixing bowl. Add pinch of Chinese
   spice, if using.
4. Pour the sauce over pork and deglaze the bottom of the pot, about 2
   minutes. Add water. Mix well and bring it to boil over high heat, reduce
   heat and simmer for 20 minutes with uncovered until pork belly is
   tender and sauce thicken. Stir occasionally. Meanwhile, chop some
   cilantro, julienne cucumber and slice some red/green chili. Also steam
   your buns during this time.
5. In the steamed buns, fill up with braised pork belly, cucumber, cilantro
   and chili. Garnish with crushed peanut and it's ready to serve! You can
   serve the braised pork on top of rice or make this sandwich on regular
   sandwich roll or baguette too.
