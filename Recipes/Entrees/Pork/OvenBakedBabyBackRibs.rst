Ingredients
-----------

- 2 whole slabs pork baby back ribs
- 1/2 recipe `Alton Brown's Dry Rub <#alton-brown-dry-rub>`__
- 1 cup white wine
- 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped

Directions
-----------
1. Preheat oven to 250 degrees.
2. Place each slab of baby back ribs on a piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil,
   shiny side down. Sprinkle each side generously with the dry rub. Pat the
   dry rub into the meat. Refrigerate the ribs for a minimum of 1 hour but
   preferably overnight.
3. In a microwavable container, combine wine, vinegar, worcestershire, honey
   and garlic for the braising liquid. Microwave on high for 1 minute.
4. Place the ribs on a baking sheet. Open one end of the foil on each slab
   and pour half of the braising liquid into each foil packet. Tilt the
   baking sheet in order to equally distribute the braising liquid. Braise
   the ribs in the oven for 2 1/2 hours.
5. Transfer the braising liquid into a medium saucepot. Bring the liquid to
   a simmer and reduce by half or until of a thick syrup consistency. Brush
   the glaze onto the ribs. Place under the broiler just until the glaze
   caramelizes lightly. Slice each slab into 2 rib bone portions. Place the
   remaining hot glaze into a bowl and toss the rib portions in the glaze.
