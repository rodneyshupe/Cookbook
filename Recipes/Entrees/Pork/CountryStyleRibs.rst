-----------

- 1 bottle of BBQ Sauce (I use Bull's-Eye Original Bold) or 1 1/2 cup homemade `Barbecue Sauce <#kansas-city-style-sweet-and-smoky-barbecue-sauce>`__
- 1/2 bottle favorite beer (you can use water or even pineapple juice)
- 1/2 onion roughly chopped
- 2 teaspoons liquid smoke (optional)

Directions
----------

1. Place ribs in cast iron pan or disposable foil pan. Pour over BBQ sauce and
   stir ribs around to coat.  Add beer and liquid smoke if using and mix ribs
   around.  Top with onion.  Cover tightly with aluminum foil.
2. Put on grill with heat at medium low and cook for 30 minutes.  Uncover and
   stir/mix ribs around and replace foil cover. Cook for an additional
   30 minutes.
3. Adjust heat to high and remove ribs from pan and place on grill.  Grill
   each side for 2 minutes.
