Ingredients
-----------

- 1/2 cup fresh pineapple chunks
- 1/4 cup chipotle in adobo sauce (approx 2)
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 3 tablespoons honey
- 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice (approx 1 lime)
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 pork tenderloins
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- Salt & pepper


Directions
----------

1. Heat your oven to 425ºF and line a sheet pan with aluminum foil or
   parchment paper.
2. Add the pineapple, chipotle in adobo, and garlic to a small food
   processor or smoothie blender and blitz until smooth. Transfer to a
   small saucepan, whisk in the honey and lime juice, and add the butter.
3. Place over medium-low heat and bring to a simmer. Cook for eight to
   10 minutes to melt the butter and combine all the flavours.
4. Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Drizzle the
   pork with oil and season with salt and pepper. Sear the pork for two
   to three minutes per side, then transfer it to the prepared sheet pan.
5. Divide over the sauce and transfer the pork to the oven to roast for
   15 to 18 minutes or until cooked to your liking or 145ºF.
6. Set the pork aside to rest for five to 10 minutes before thickly
   slicing and serving.
