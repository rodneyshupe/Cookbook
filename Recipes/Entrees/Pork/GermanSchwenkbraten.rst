1. Mix the oil with the garlic, mustard and the rest of the spices in a bowl.
2. Add the steaks, the onions and marinade to large ziplock bag and
   refrigerate for 8 to 24 hours, mixing a few times to redistribute the oil.
3. Place schnitzel (without onions) in a single layer over direct heat,
   salt (a little) and grill for 5 to 8 minutes per side.

If you cannot find pork steaks already cut, buy a whole pork shoulder roast
(or similar roast), debone it, and cut the meat crosswise, 1/2 to 3/4 inches
thick to make steaks.
