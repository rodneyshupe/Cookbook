Directions
----------

1. Make steamed bun dough recipe first before the filling unless you are
   making the filling a day ahead.
2. While dough's rising let's make BBQ Pork Filling. In a mixing bowl,
   combine stock, corn starch, oyster, hosin, soy sauces, sugar, Shaoxing,
   and 5 spice. Whisk until sugar is dissolved. Set aside.
3. Heat a large skillet or wok over high heat; add oil and swirl to coat.
   Add diced onion and garlic; stir fry for 2 to 3 minutes or until onion
   is soften and transparent.
4. Add pork into wok and stir fry for 5 minutes or until pork pieces are
   slightly browned.
5. Add sauce we made earlier; bring it to boil and reduce heat to medium
   then simmer for 5 minutes or until it thickens. Stirling frequently.
   Transfer to a bowl and cover. Let it cool in a refrigerator for 1 to 2
   hours or in a freezer for 30 minutes.
6. While filling is cooling, divide dough into 2 oz. of 14 equal portions.
   Roll each piece on your palm. Place them on a parchment paper/coffee
   filter lined baking sheet or a flat surface and cover with plastic wrap
   or a towel; let it rest for additional 20 minutes.
7. When your dough and filling is ready, let's make porks buns. Bring one
   dough at a time to work surface, slightly flatten it with your palm.
   Using a rolling pin, flatten dough into 3” circle, but make sure center
   is slightly thicker than its edge.
8. Put 1 Tablespoon of pork filling into center and bring edge to top with
   your index finger and thumb to seal while your left thumb is pushing
   filling inside. Place sealed bun on a parchment paper, cupcake paper cup
   or coffee filleter.
9. Arrange pork buns back to a baking sheet or a flat surface and cover
   with plastic wrap or a towel; let it rest for additional 20 minutes.
10. When your pork buns are well rested and all cute looking, it's ready to
    steam. Fill a wok or steamer pot with water and bring it to boil over
    high heat.Place pork buns into a steamer rack with paper underneath.
    Make sure they are too close to each other, at least 1” apart. Bring a
    steamer rack with pork buns to boiling steamer. Make sure water is not
    touching pork buns. Cover and steam for 12 to 14 minutes or until pork
    buns are fluffy and fully cooked.
11. Tilt lid tiny bit for a slow air circulation for 2 to 3 minutes before
    open lid. If you open lid right away, nice fluffy buns will sink down
    on you and you don't want that happen. Serve hot. Enjoy!
