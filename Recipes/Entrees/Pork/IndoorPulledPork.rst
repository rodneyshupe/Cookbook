-  1 cup plus 2 teaspoons table salt
-  1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
-  3 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons liquid smoke
-  1 boneless pork butt, about 5 pounds (2.3kg), cut in half horizontally (see step by step below)
-  1/4 cup yellow mustard

Sweet and Tangy Barbecue Sauce
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  1 1/2 cups ketchup
-  1/4 cup light or mild molasses
-  2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
-  1 tablespoon hot sauce
-  1/2 teaspoon table salt
-  1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions
----------

Pork
^^^^

1. For the pork: Dissolve 1 cup salt, 1/2 cup sugar, and 3 tablespoons
   liquid smoke in 4 quarts cold water in large container. Submerge pork
   in brine, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 2 hours.
2. While pork brines, combine mustard and remaining 2 teaspoons liquid
   smoke in small bowl; set aside. Combine black pepper, paprika,
   remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, remaining 2 teaspoons salt, and
   cayenne in second small bowl; set aside. Adjust oven rack to
   lower-middle position and heat oven to 325°F.
3. Remove pork from brine and dry thoroughly with paper towels. Rub
   mustard mixture over entire surface of each piece of pork. Sprinkle
   entire surface of each piece with spice mixture. Place pork on wire
   rack set inside foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Place piece of
   parchment paper over pork, then cover with sheet of aluminum foil,
   sealing edges to prevent moisture from escaping. Roast pork for 3
   hours.
4. Remove pork from oven; remove and discard foil and parchment.
   Carefully pour off liquid in bottom of baking sheet into fat
   separator and reserve for sauce. Return pork to oven and cook,
   uncovered, until well browned, tender, and internal temperature
   registers 200°F on instant-read thermometer, about 1 1/2 hours.
   Transfer pork to serving dish, tent loosely with foil, and let rest
   for 20 minutes.
5. To serve: Using 2°Forks, shred pork into bite-sized pieces. Toss with
   1 cup sauce and season with salt and pepper. Serve, passing remaining
   sauce separately.

Sweet and Tangy Sauce
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. While pork rests, pour 1/2 cup of defatted cooking liquid from fat
   separator into medium bowl; whisk in sauce ingredients.

Notes
-----

Sweet paprika may be substituted for smoked paprika. Covering the pork
with parchment and then foil prevents the acidic mustard from eating
holes in the foil. Serve the pork on hamburger rolls with pickle chips
and thinly sliced onion. As an alternative to the Sweet and Tangy
Barbecue Sauce, use 2 cups of your favorite barbecue sauce thinned with
1/2 cup of the defatted pork cooking liquid in step 5. The shredded and
sauced pork can be cooled, tightly covered, and refrigerated for up to 2
days. Reheat it gently before serving.
