Ingredients
-----------

- 10 large dried guajillo chile, wiped clean
- 1 1/2 cups water
- 1 1/4 pounds plum tomato, cored and quartered
- 8 garlic clove, peeled
- 4 bay leaf
- Salt and pepper
- 3/4 teaspoon sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
- 3 pounds boneless pork butt roast
- 1 lime, cut into 8 wedges
- 1/2 pineapple, peeled, cored, and cut into 1/2-inch-thick rings
- Vegetable oil
- 18 (6-inch) corn tortilla, warmed
- 1 small onion, chopped fine
- 1/2 cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro

Directions
----------

1. Toast guajillos in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until softened
   and fragrant, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer to large plate and, when cool
   enough to handle, remove stems.
2. Bring toasted guajillos, water, tomatoes, garlic, bay leaves, 2
   teaspoons salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, sugar, cumin, and cloves to simmer
   in now-empty Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cover, reduce heat, and
   simmer, stirring occasionally, until guajillos are softened and tomatoes
   mash easily, about 20 minutes.
3. While sauce simmers, trim excess fat from exterior of pork, leaving
   1/4-inch-thick fat cap. Slice pork against grain into 1/2-inch-thick
   slabs.
4. Transfer guajillo-tomato mixture to blender and process until smooth,
   about 1 minute. Strain puree through fine-mesh strainer, pressing on
   solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Return puree to pot,
   submerge pork slices in liquid, and bring to simmer over medium heat.
   Partially cover, reduce heat, and gently simmer until pork is tender but
   still holds together, 90 to 105 minutes, flipping and rearranging pork
   halfway through cooking. (Pork can be left in sauce, cooled to room
   temperature, and refrigerated, covered, for up to 2 days.)
5. Transfer pork to large plate, season both sides with salt, and cover
   tightly with aluminum foil. Whisk sauce to combine. Transfer 1/2 cup to
   bowl for grilling; pour off all but 1/2 cup remaining sauce from pot and
   reserve for another use. Squeeze 2 lime wedges into sauce in pot and add
   spent wedges; season with salt to taste.
6. Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes.
   Turn all burners to medium.
7. Clean and oil cooking grate. Brush 1 side of pork with 1/4 cup reserved
   sauce. Place pork on 1 side of grill, sauce side down, and cook until
   well browned and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Brush pork with remaining 1/4
   cup reserved sauce, flip, and continue to cook until second side is well
   browned and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes longer. Transfer to cutting board.
   Meanwhile, brush both sides of pineapple rings with vegetable oil and
   season with salt to taste. Place on other half of grill and cook until
   pineapple is softened and caramelized, 5 to 7 minutes per side; transfer
   pineapple to cutting board.
8. Coarsely chop grilled pineapple and transfer to serving bowl. Using
   tongs or carving fork to steady hot pork, slice each piece crosswise
   into 1/8-inch pieces. Bring remaining 1/2 cup sauce in pot to simmer,
   add sliced pork, remove pot from heat, and toss to coat pork well.
   Season with salt to taste.
9. Spoon small amount of pork into each warm tortilla and serve, passing
   chopped pineapple, remaining 6 lime wedges, onion, and cilantro separately.

Notes
-----

Boneless pork butt is often labeled Boston butt. If you can't find guajillo
chiles, New Mexican chiles may be substituted, although the dish may be
spicier. To warm tortillas, place them on a plate, cover with a damp
kitchen towel, and microwave for 60 to 90 seconds. Keep tortillas covered
and serve immediately.
