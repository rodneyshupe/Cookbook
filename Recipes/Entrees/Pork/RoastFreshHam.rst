Orange, Cinnamon, and Star Anise Glaze
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  1 cup orange juice
-  1 tablespoon grated orange zest
-  2 cups packed brown sugar (dark or light)
-  4 star anise (pods)
-  1 cinnamon stick (3-inches)

Spicy Pineapple-Ginger Glaze
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  1 cup pineapple juice
-  2 cups packed brown sugar (dark or light)
-  1 inch piece fresh ginger, grated (about 1 tablespoon)
-  1 tablespoon red pepper flakes

Apple Cider and Brown Sugar Glaze
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  1 cup apple cider
-  2 cups packed brown sugar (dark or light)
-  5 whole cloves

Directions
----------

1. Carefully slice through skin and fat with serrated knife, making
   1-inch diamond pattern. Be careful not to cut into meat.
2. In large (about 16-quart) bucket or stockpot, dissolve salt and brown
   sugar in 1 gallon hot tap water. Add garlic, bay leaves, black
   pepper, and 1 gallon cold water. Submerge ham in brine and
   refrigerate 8 to 24 hours.
3. Set large disposable roasting pan on baking sheet for extra support;
   place flat wire rack in roasting pan. Remove ham from brine; rinse
   under cold water and dry thoroughly with paper towels. Place ham,
   wide cut-side down, on rack. (If using sirloin end, place ham
   skin-side up.) Let ham stand, uncovered, at room temperature 1 hour.
4. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to
   500°F. In work bowl of food processor fitted with steel blade,
   process sage, parsley, garlic, salt, pepper, and oil until mixture
   forms smooth paste, about 30 seconds. Rub all sides of ham with
   paste.
5. Roast ham at 500°F for 20 minutes. While ham is roasting make the
   glaze. Bring all glaze ingredients to boil in small nonreactive
   saucepan over high heat; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until
   syrupy and reduced to about 1 1/3 cups, 5 to 7 minutes. (Glaze will
   thicken as it cools between bastings; cook over medium heat about 1
   minute, stirring once or twice, before using.)
6. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F and continue to roast, brushing ham
   with glaze every 45 minutes, until center of ham registers 145°F to
   150°F on instant-read thermometer (see illustration below for
   thermometer placement), about 2 1/2 hours longer. Tent ham loosely
   with foil and let stand until center of ham registers 155°F to 160°F
   on thermometer, 30 to 40 minutes. Carve, following instructions
   below, and serve.
