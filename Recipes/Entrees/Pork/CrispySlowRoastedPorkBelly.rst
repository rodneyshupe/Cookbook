Ingredients
-----------

- 1 (3-pound) skin-on center-cut fresh pork belly, about 1 1/2 inches thick
- Kosher salt
- 2 tablespoons packed dark brown sugar
- Vegetable oil

Directions
----------

1. Using sharp chef's knife, slice pork belly lengthwise into 3 strips
   about 2 inches wide, then make 1/4-inch-deep crosswise cuts through skin
   and into fat spaced 1/2 inch apart. Combine 2 tablespoons salt and brown
   sugar in small bowl. Rub salt mixture into bottom and sides of pork
   belly (do not rub into skin). Season skin of each strip evenly with 1/2
   teaspoon salt. Place pork belly, skin side up, in 13 by 9-inch baking
   dish and refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 12 hours or up to 24
   hours.
2. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 250 degrees.
   Transfer pork belly, skin side up, to lightly greased wire rack set in
   rimmed baking sheet. Roast pork belly until meat registers 195 degrees
   and paring knife inserted in meat meets little resistance, 3 to 3 1/2
   hours, rotating sheet halfway through roasting.
3. Transfer pork belly, skin side up, to large plate. (Pork belly can be
   held at room temperature for up to 1 hour.) Pour fat from sheet into
   1-cup liquid measuring cup. Add vegetable oil as needed to equal 1 cup
   and transfer to 12-inch skillet. Arrange pork belly, skin side down, in
   skillet (strips can be sliced in half crosswise if skillet won't fit
   strips whole) and place over medium heat until bubbles form around pork
   belly. Continue to fry, tilting skillet occasionally to even out hot
   spots, until skin puffs, crisps, and turns golden, 6 to 10 minutes.
   Transfer pork belly, skin side up, to carving board and let rest for 5
   minutes. Flip pork belly on its side and slice 1/2 inch thick (being
   sure to slice through original score marks). Reinvert slices and serve.

Notes
-----

This recipe requires seasoning and refrigerating the pork belly for at
least 12 hours before cooking. Be sure to ask for a flat, rectangular
center-cut section of skin-on pork belly that's 1 1/2 inches thick with
roughly equal amounts of meat and fat. Serve the meat in small portions
with our `Spicy Mustard Sauce <#spicy-mustard-sauce>`__,
`Sweet and Sour Chile Sauce <#sweet-and-sour-chile-sauce>`__, or
`Tangy Hoisin Sauce <#tangy-hoisin-sauce>`__, plus white rice and steamed
