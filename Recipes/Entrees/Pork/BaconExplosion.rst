Bacon explosion
===============

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 pounds (900g) thick-cut sliced bacon
-  1 1/2 pounds (680g) Italian sausage, casings removed
-  3 tablespoons barbecue rub
-  3/4 cup barbecue sauce.

Directions
----------

1. Using 10 slices of bacon, weave a square lattice like that on top of
   a pie: first, place 5 bacon slices side by side on a large sheet of
   aluminum foil, parallel to one another, sides touching. Place another
   strip of bacon on one end, perpendicular to the other strips. Fold
   first, third and fifth bacon strips back over this new strip, then
   place another strip next to it, parallel to it. Unfold first, third
   and fifth strips; fold back second and fourth strips. Repeat with
   remaining bacon until all 10 strips are tightly woven.
2. Preheat oven to 225°F or light a fire in an outdoor smoker. Place
   remaining bacon in a frying pan and cook until crisp. As it cooks,
   sprinkle bacon weave with 1 tablespoon barbecue rub. evenly spread
   sausage on top of bacon lattice, pressing to outer edges.
3. Crumble fried bacon into bite-size pieces. Sprinkle on top of
   sausage. Drizzle with 1/2 cup barbecue sauce and sprinkle with
   another tablespoon barbecue rub.
4. Very carefully separate front edge of sausage layer from bacon weave
   and begin rolling sausage away from you. Bacon weave should stay
   where it was, flat. Press sausage roll to remove any air pockets and
   pinch together seams and ends.
5. Roll sausage toward you, this time with bacon weave, until it is
   completely wrapped. Turn it so seam faces down. Roll should be about
   2 to 3 inches thick. Sprinkle with remaining barbecue rub.
6. Place roll on a baking sheet in oven or in smoker. Cook until
   internal temperature reaches 165°F on a meat thermometer, about 1
   hour for each inch of thickness. When done, glaze roll with more
   sauce. To serve, slice into 1/4 to 1/2-inch rounds.
