Char Siu
========

This can be enjoyed by it self, or on top of warm bowl of rice, ramen
noodle soup, or in between `steamed buns (bao) <#bao-buns>`__. Leftovers
would be perfect to make fried rice or fried noodles! It also can be a
protein for your salad.

Ingredients
-----------

- 1/2 lb pork loin
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1/2 tablespoon dark soy sauce
- 1 tablespoons hoisin sauce
- 1 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 1 tablespoons shaoxing wine (substiture dry sherry)
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1/2 tablespoon smoked paprika
- Remaining glaze (about 2-3 tablespoons)
- 3 tablespoons honey plus more for final glaze

Directions
----------

1. Cut the pork loin in half lengthwise and place in a baking dish or
   plastic bag. Combine all ingredients for marinade and whisk until
   honey is completely dissolved. Pour the 3/4 of the marinade into the
   pork and move the pork around so it will sit in marinade evenly, reserve
   remaining for glaze. Let it marinade at least 6 hours to 48 hours.
2. Preheat the oven to high broil (500F to 550F) for 10 to 15 minutes.
   Place a parchment paper or aluminum foil and a rack on a large baking
   sheet. Place the marinated pork on top of the prepared rack. Broil
   the pork on the lowest rack of the oven for 10 to 12 minutes.
3. Meanwhile combine remaining marinade and honey to make a glaze. Brush
   the glaze on the pork and flip it over. Glaze the other side too and
   broil another 10 to 12 minutes. Brush the glaze once again and place
   the pork on the highest rack of the oven (closest to the broil) and let
   it caramelize for 2 to 3 minutes or until the inner temperature of the
   pork reaches to 145F.
4. Remove from the oven and let it rest for 3 minutes. Brush with only 
   honey for the extra shiny. 
5. Slice as you desire and enjoy.
