Ingredients
-----------

-  1 pound (450g) pork tenderloin, trimmed
-  1 teaspoon kosher salt
-  3/4 teaspoon vegetable oil
-  1/4 teaspoon pepper
-  1/8 teaspoon baking soda
-  1 (13 by 9-inch) disposable aluminum roasting pan

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack 4 to 5 inches from broiler element and heat oven to
   325°F. Fold thin tip of tenderloin under about 2 inches to create
   uniformly shaped roast. Tie tenderloin crosswise with kitchen twine
   at 2-inch intervals, making sure folded tip is secured underneath.
   Trim any excess twine close to meat to prevent it from scorching
   under the broiler.
2. Mix salt, oil, and pepper in small bowl until salt is evenly coated
   with oil. Add baking soda and stir until well combined. Rub mixture
   evenly over pork. Place tenderloin in disposable pan.
3. Turn oven to broil. Immediately place meat in oven and broil
   tenderloin for 5 minutes. Flip tenderloin and continue to broil until
   golden brown and meat registers 125°F to 130°F, 8 to 14 minutes.
   Remove disposable pan from oven, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and
   let rest for 10 minutes. Remove twine, slice tenderloin into
   1/2-inch-thick slices, and serve.
