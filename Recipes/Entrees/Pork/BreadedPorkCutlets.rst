Breaded Pork Cutlets (Pork Schnitzel)
=====================================

Ingredients
-----------

-  7 large high-quality sandwich bread, crusts removed, cut into
   3/4-inch cubes (about 4 cups)
-  1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
-  2 large eggs
-  2 cups plus 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
-  1 pork tenderloin (1 1/4 lb). trimmed of fat and silver skin and cut
   on angle into 4 equal pieces
-  Salt and ground black pepper

Garnishes
---------

-  1 lemon, cut into wedges
-  2 tablespoon chopped fresh flat leaf parsley leaves
-  2 tablespoons capers, rinsed

Directions
----------

1. Place bread cubes on large microwave-safe plate. Microwave on high
   power for 4 minutes, stirring well halfway through cooking time.
   Microwave on medium power until bread is dry and few pieces start to
   lightly brown, 3 to 5 minutes longer, stirring every minute. Process
   dry bread in food processor to very fine crumbs, about 45 seconds.
   Transfer bread crumbs to shallow dish (you should have about 11/4
   cups crumbs). Spread flour in second shallow dish. Beat eggs with 1
   tablespoon oil in third dish.
2. Place pork, with 1 cut-side down, between 2 sheets of parchment paper
   or plastic wrap and pound to even thickness between 1/8 and 1/4 inch.
   Season cutlets with salt and pepper. Working with 1 cutlet at a time,
   dredge cutlets thoroughly in flour, shaking off excess, then coat
   with egg mixture, allowing excess to drip back into dish to ensure
   very thin coating, and coat evenly with bread crumbs, pressing on
   crumbs to adhere. Place breaded cutlets in single layer on wire rack
   set over baking sheet; let coating dry 5 minutes.
3. Heat remaining 2 cups oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat
   until it registers 375°F on instant-read thermometer. Lay 2 cutlets,
   without overlapping, in pan and cook, shaking pan continuously and
   gently, until cutlets are wrinkled and light golden brown on both
   sides, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer cutlets to paper towel-lined
   plate and flip cutlets several times to blot excess oil. Repeat with
   remaining cutlets. Serve immediately with garnishes.

Notes
-----

In lieu of an instant-read thermometer to gauge the oil’s temperature,
place a fresh (not dry) bread cube in the oil and start heating; when
the bread is deep golden brown, the oil is ready.
