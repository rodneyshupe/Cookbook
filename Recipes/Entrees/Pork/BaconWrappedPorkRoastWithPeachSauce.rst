Ingredients
-----------
- Kosher salt and pepper
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 boneless center-cut pork loin roast, about 3 1/2 pounds (1.6kg)
- 1 recipe of `Peach Sauce <#peach-sauce>`__
- 2 teaspoons herbes de Provence
- 10 slices bacon

Directions
----------
1. Combine 4 teaspoons salt and sugar in bowl. Remove fat cap and silverskin
   from roast. Rub roast with salt-sugar mixture, wrap in plastic wrap, and
   refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours.
2. After making sauce, reserve 2 tablespoons of liquid portion of sauce
   (without peach segments) in small bowl for glazing. Cover and set aside
   remaining sauce.
3. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to
   250 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with
   vegetable oil spray. Unwrap roast and pat dry with paper towels. Sprinkle
   with herbes de Provence and 1 teaspoon pepper.
4. Arrange bacon slices on cutting board parallel to counterâ€™s edge,
   overlapping them slightly to match length of roast. Place roast in center
   of bacon, perpendicular to slices. Bring ends of bacon up and around sides
   of roast, overlapping ends of slices as needed.
5. Place bacon-wrapped roast, seam side down, in center of prepared sheet.
   Roast until center of pork registers 90 degrees, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove
   roast from oven and increase oven temperature to 475 degrees.
6. Brush top and sides of roast with reserved 2 tablespoons sauce. Once oven
   reaches temperature, return pork to oven and roast until bacon is well
   browned and meat registers 130 degrees, 15 to 20 minutes longer. Transfer
   roast to wire rack and let rest for 15 minutes.
7. Transfer roast to carving board and cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices.
   Serve with peach sauce.
