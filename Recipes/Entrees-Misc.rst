Paella on the Grill
===================

This recipe shortened the outdoor cooking time by using roasted red
peppers and tomato paste (instead of fresh peppers and tomatoes), making
an infused broth with the seasonings, and grilling (rather than searing)
the chicken thighs. This also deliberately places the chicken on the
perimeter of the pan, where it would finish cooking gently after
grilling, and the sausage and seafood in the center, where they were
partially submerged in the liquid so that they cooked through; once the
liquid reduced, the steam kept them warm.

Ingredients
-----------

-  1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed and halved
   crosswise
-  Salt and pepper
-  12 ounces jumbo shrimp (16 to 20 per pound), peeled and deveined
-  6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
-  6 garlic cloves, minced
-  1 3/4 teaspoons hot smoked paprika
-  3 tablespoons tomato paste
-  4 cups chicken broth
-  1 (8-ounce) bottle clam juice
-  2/3 cup dry sherry
-  Pinch saffron threads (optional)
-  1 onion, chopped fine
-  1/2 cup jarred roasted red peppers, chopped fine
-  3 cups Arborio rice
-  1 pound littleneck clams, scrubbed
-  1 pound Spanish-style chorizo sausage, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
-  1 cup frozen peas, thawed
-  Lemon wedges

Directions
----------

1. Place chicken on large plate and sprinkle both sides with 1 teaspoon
   salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Toss shrimp with 1 tablespoon oil, 1/2
   teaspoon garlic, 1/4 teaspoon paprika, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in bowl
   until evenly coated. Set aside.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in medium saucepan over medium heat until
   shimmering. Add remaining garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until
   garlic sticks to bottom of saucepan and begins to brown, about 1
   minute. Add tomato paste and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons paprika and
   continue to cook, stirring constantly, until dark brown bits form on
   bottom of saucepan, about 1 minute. Add broth, clam juice, sherry,
   and saffron, if using. Increase heat to high and bring to boil.
   Remove saucepan from heat and set aside.
3. Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15
   minutes. Leave all burners on high.
4. Clean and oil cooking grate. Place chicken on grill and cook until
   both sides are lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes total. Return chicken
   to plate. Clean cooking grate.
5. Place roasting pan on grill (turning burners to medium-high if using
   gas) and add remaining 1/4 cup oil. When oil begins to shimmer, add
   onion, red peppers, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring frequently,
   until onion begins to brown, 4 to 7 minutes. Add rice (turning
   burners to medium) and stir until grains are well coated with oil.
6. Arrange chicken around perimeter of pan. Pour broth mixture and any
   accumulated juices from chicken over rice. Smooth rice into even
   layer, making sure nothing sticks to sides of pan and no rice rests
   atop chicken. When liquid reaches gentle simmer, place shrimp in
   center of pan in single layer. Arrange clams in center of pan, evenly
   distributing with shrimp and pushing hinge sides of clams into rice
   slightly so they stand up. Distribute chorizo evenly over surface of
   rice. Cook covered, moving and rotating pan to maintain gentle simmer
   across entire surface of pan, until rice is almost cooked through, 12
   to 18 minutes. (Heat can also be adjusted to maintain simmer.)
7. Sprinkle peas evenly over paella, cover grill, and cook until liquid
   is fully absorbed and rice on bottom of pan sizzles, 5 to 8 minutes.
   Continue to cook, uncovered, checking bottom of pan frequently with
   metal spoon, until uniform golden-brown crust forms, 8 to 15 minutes
   longer. (Rotate and slide pan around grill as necessary to ensure
   even crust formation.) Remove pan from grill, cover with aluminum
   foil, and let stand for 10 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges.

Cast Iron Paella
================

A traditional stainless-steel pan would have to sit over high heat for
the last 5 minutes of cooking to develop this crust, which creates a
high risk of the more delicate ingredients overcooking, but the
cast-iron pan, with its high heat retention, naturally created the crust
during the course of cooking the recipe without any extra steps.

Ingredients
-----------

-  12 oz extra large shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), peeled and deveined
-  9 garlic cloves, minced
-  3 tablespoons vegetable oil
-  Salt and pepper
-  12 oz boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed and halved crosswise
-  8 oz Spanish-style chorizo sausage, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
-  1 red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and chopped fine
-  1 onion, chopped fine
-  2 1/4 cups Arborio rice
-  1/2 teaspoon saffron threads
-  1 (14.5 oz) can diced tomatoes, drained
-  2 1/4 cups chicken broth
-  1/4 cup dry white wine
-  12 mussels, scrubbed and debearded
-  1/2 cup frozen peas, thawed
-  Lemon wedges

Directions
----------

1. Toss shrimp with 1 teaspoon garlic and 1 tablespoon oil and season
   with salt and pepper; set aside. Pat chicken dry with paper towels
   and season with salt and pepper. Heat 12-inch cast-iron skillet over
   medium heat for 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon oil and heat until just
   smoking. Brown chicken on all sides, about 6 minutes; transfer to
   bowl.
2. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in now-empty skillet until
   shimmering. Add chorizo, bell pepper, onion, and 1/4 teaspoon salt
   and cook until vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in
   rice, saffron, and remaining garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30
   seconds. Stir in tomatoes and cook until mixture begins to darken and
   thicken slightly, about 3 minutes. Stir in broth and wine, scraping
   up any browned bits, and bring to simmer.
3. Nestle chicken into skillet. Reduce heat to gentle simmer, cover, and
   cook until most of liquid is absorbed and rice is al dente, about 15
   minutes.
4. Insert mussels hinged side down into rice (so they stand upright) and
   scatter shrimp over top. Cover and cook until shrimp are opaque
   throughout and mussels have opened, 6 to 8 minutes.
5. Off heat, discard any mussels that refuse to open. Scatter peas over
   rice, cover, and let sit until heated through, about 5 minutes. Serve
   immediately with lemon wedges.

Classic Risotto
===============

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
-  1 onion, chopped
-  4 clove garlic, minced
-  2 cup Arborio rice
-  1 cup Italian white wine
-  8 cup real chicken broth, simmering hot
-  1 cup good quality Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, shredded
-  1 Tbsp (or so) of butter
-  a few sprigs of fresh thyme or any fresh herb, minced

Directions
----------

1. Lightly simmer the chicken broth in one pot as you make the risotto
   in another pot.
2. Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, then add in the
   onions and garlic. Saute until golden and fragrant, a few minutes.
   Add the rice and continue to cook and stir over medium high heat,
   coating the grains evenly with the oil, until the rice grains give
   off a toasty aroma and transform from pure white to almost entirely
   opaque.
3. Add in the white wine and stir frequently as the rice absorbs the
   liquid. Reduce your heat to low. Start adding the hot chicken stock
   in several additions, stirring frequently after each one and allowing
   the rice to absorb the broth. Continue to cook and stir the risotto
   until the rice is just tender or al dente (soft with an ever so
   slight bite to the center) and creamy. The Arborio rice will
   gradually release its starch and thicken the extra liquid into
   creaminess. Creamy is important if you’re going for authenticity!
   This will take about 20 minutes from when you start adding the
   liquid.
4. To finish stir in the Parmesan, butter and minced fresh herbs. Spoon
   into dishes piping hot and share.

Variations
----------

1. Cook 1 diced chorizo before step 2 in the pan. Remove choizo and set
   aside. In step 2 use rendered fat in place of some of the olive oil.
   Re-add chorico when adding last batch of liquid in step 3. Add 1 cup
   of cooked peas in step 4 instead of herbs.
2. Add chopped meat from 1 lobster tail to risotto mixture in step 3
   half way through adding the liquids.

Directions
----------

1. Toss meat, seafood, or tofu with soy sauce and sherry in medium bowl;
   set aside. Combine all sauce ingredients in a second small bowl.
   Divide vegetables into two or three batches according to ingredient
   list.
2. Heat 12- or 14-inch nonstick skillet over high heat, 4 minutes (pan
   should be so hot, you can hold your outstretched hand 1 inch above
   its surface for no more than 3 seconds); add 1 tablespoon oil (add 2
   tablespoons for tofu or fish) and rotate pan so that bottom is evenly
   coated. Let oil heat until it just starts to shimmer and smoke. Check
   heat with hand. Drain meat, seafood, or tofu, then add to pan and
   stir-fry until seared and about three-quarters cooked (about 20
   seconds for fish, 60 seconds for meat, 2 minutes for tofu, 2 1/2 to 3
   minutes for chicken). Spoon cooked meat or seafood into serving dish.
   Cover and keep warm.
3. Let pan come back up to temperature, 1 or 2 minutes. When hot,
   drizzle in 2 teaspoons of oil, and when oil just starts to smoke, add
   vegetables from first category. Stir-fry until vegetables are just
   tender-crisp, about 2 minutes. Leaving first batch in pan, repeat
   with remaining vegetables, cooking each set of vegetables until
   tender-crisp, or for fourth category, wilted. Add about a teaspoon of
   oil for each new batch (amount of oil will depend on skillet you are
   using-nonstick pans require about a teaspoon; other pans may require
   2 teaspoons). Clear center of pan and add garlic, ginger, and
   scallions. Drizzle with 1/2 teaspoon of oil. Mash into pan with back
   of a spatula. Cook for 10 seconds. Remove pan from heat and stir
   garlic/ginger mixture into vegetables for 20 seconds.
4. Return pan to heat and add cooked meat, seafood, or tofu. Stir in
   sauce and stir-fry to coat all ingredients, about 1 minute. Serve
   immediately with rice.

Note: Stir Fry Fundamentals
---------------------------

*No matter what you’re stir-frying, follow these guidelines to ensure
success.* - Be ready for quick cooking: Prep ingredients in advance. -
For even browning, use a nonstick skillet, not a wok. - Limit stirring
so meat and vegetables can develop color. - Sear in batches so meat
doesn’t steam. - Add aromatics last to preserve flavor and avoid
scorching.

Homemade Pizza Dough
====================

+--------------------+----------------+
| Prep Time: 2 hours | Yield: 1 pound |
+--------------------+----------------+

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 cups (11 oz) bread flour, plus extra for work surface
-  1 teaspoon instant or rapid rise yeast
-  3/4 teaspoon salt
-  2 tablespoons olive oil, plus extra for bowl
-  1 cup warm water

Directions
----------

1. Pulse the flour, yeast, and salt in a food processor (fitted with
   dough blade if possible) to combine. With the food processor running,
   pour the oil, then the water through the feed tube and process until
   a rough ball forms, 30 to 40 seconds. Let the dough rest in the bowl
   for 2 minutes, then process for 30 seconds longer.
2. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead by
   hand to form a smooth, round ball, about 5 minutes, adding additional
