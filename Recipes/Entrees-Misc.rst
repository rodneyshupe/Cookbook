Paella on the Grill
===================

This recipe shortened the outdoor cooking time by using roasted red
peppers and tomato paste (instead of fresh peppers and tomatoes), making
an infused broth with the seasonings, and grilling (rather than searing)
the chicken thighs. This also deliberately places the chicken on the
perimeter of the pan, where it would finish cooking gently after
grilling, and the sausage and seafood in the center, where they were
partially submerged in the liquid so that they cooked through; once the
liquid reduced, the steam kept them warm.

Ingredients
-----------
-  1 1/2 pounds (680g) boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed and halved crosswise
-  Salt and pepper
-  12 ounces (340g) jumbo shrimp (16 to 20 per pound), peeled and deveined
-  6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
-  6 garlic cloves, minced
-  1 3/4 teaspoons hot smoked paprika
-  3 tablespoons tomato paste
-  4 cups chicken broth
-  1 bottle, 8 ounce (236ml) clam juice
-  2/3 cup dry sherry
-  Pinch saffron threads (optional)
-  1 onion, chopped fine
-  1/2 cup jarred roasted red peppers, chopped fine
-  3 cups Arborio rice
-  1 pound (450g) littleneck clams, scrubbed
-  1 pound (450g) Spanish-style chorizo sausage, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
-  1 cup frozen peas, thawed
-  Lemon wedges

Directions
----------

1. Place chicken on large plate and sprinkle both sides with 1 teaspoon
   salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Toss shrimp with 1 tablespoon oil, 1/2
   teaspoon garlic, 1/4 teaspoon paprika, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in bowl
   until evenly coated. Set aside.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in medium saucepan over medium heat until
   shimmering. Add remaining garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until
   garlic sticks to bottom of saucepan and begins to brown, about 1
   minute. Add tomato paste and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons paprika and
   continue to cook, stirring constantly, until dark brown bits form on
   bottom of saucepan, about 1 minute. Add broth, clam juice, sherry,
   and saffron, if using. Increase heat to high and bring to boil.
   Remove saucepan from heat and set aside.
3. Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15
   minutes. Leave all burners on high.
4. Clean and oil cooking grate. Place chicken on grill and cook until
   both sides are lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes total. Return chicken
   to plate. Clean cooking grate.
5. Place roasting pan on grill (turning burners to medium-high if using
   gas) and add remaining 1/4 cup oil. When oil begins to shimmer, add
   onion, red peppers, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring frequently,
   until onion begins to brown, 4 to 7 minutes. Add rice (turning
   burners to medium) and stir until grains are well coated with oil.
6. Arrange chicken around perimeter of pan. Pour broth mixture and any
   accumulated juices from chicken over rice. Smooth rice into even
   layer, making sure nothing sticks to sides of pan and no rice rests
   atop chicken. When liquid reaches gentle simmer, place shrimp in
   center of pan in single layer. Arrange clams in center of pan, evenly
   distributing with shrimp and pushing hinge sides of clams into rice
   slightly so they stand up. Distribute chorizo evenly over surface of
   rice. Cook covered, moving and rotating pan to maintain gentle simmer
   across entire surface of pan, until rice is almost cooked through, 12
   to 18 minutes. (Heat can also be adjusted to maintain simmer.)
7. Sprinkle peas evenly over paella, cover grill, and cook until liquid
   is fully absorbed and rice on bottom of pan sizzles, 5 to 8 minutes.
   Continue to cook, uncovered, checking bottom of pan frequently with
   metal spoon, until uniform golden-brown crust forms, 8 to 15 minutes
   longer. (Rotate and slide pan around grill as necessary to ensure
   even crust formation.) Remove pan from grill, cover with aluminum
   foil, and let stand for 10 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges.

Cast Iron Paella
================

A traditional stainless-steel pan would have to sit over high heat for
the last 5 minutes of cooking to develop this crust, which creates a
high risk of the more delicate ingredients overcooking, but the
cast-iron pan, with its high heat retention, naturally created the crust
during the course of cooking the recipe without any extra steps.

Ingredients
-----------

-  12 ounce (340g) extra large shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), peeled and deveined
-  9 garlic cloves, minced
-  3 tablespoons vegetable oil
-  Salt and pepper
-  12 ounce (340g) boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed and halved crosswise
-  8 ounce (225g) Spanish-style chorizo sausage, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
-  1 red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and chopped fine
-  1 onion, chopped fine
-  2 1/4 cups Arborio rice
-  1/2 teaspoon saffron threads
-  1 can, 14.5 ounce (428ml) diced tomatoes, drained
-  2 1/4 cups chicken broth
-  1/4 cup dry white wine
-  12 mussels, scrubbed and debearded
-  1/2 cup frozen peas, thawed
-  Lemon wedges

Directions
----------

1. Toss shrimp with 1 teaspoon garlic and 1 tablespoon oil and season
   with salt and pepper; set aside. Pat chicken dry with paper towels
   and season with salt and pepper. Heat 12-inch cast-iron skillet over
   medium heat for 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon oil and heat until just
   smoking. Brown chicken on all sides, about 6 minutes; transfer to
   bowl.
2. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in now-empty skillet until
   shimmering. Add chorizo, bell pepper, onion, and 1/4 teaspoon salt
   and cook until vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in
   rice, saffron, and remaining garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30
   seconds. Stir in tomatoes and cook until mixture begins to darken and
   thicken slightly, about 3 minutes. Stir in broth and wine, scraping
   up any browned bits, and bring to simmer.
3. Nestle chicken into skillet. Reduce heat to gentle simmer, cover, and
   cook until most of liquid is absorbed and rice is al dente, about 15
   minutes.
4. Insert mussels hinged side down into rice (so they stand upright) and
   scatter shrimp over top. Cover and cook until shrimp are opaque
   throughout and mussels have opened, 6 to 8 minutes.
5. Off heat, discard any mussels that refuse to open. Scatter peas over
   rice, cover, and let sit until heated through, about 5 minutes. Serve
   immediately with lemon wedges.

Classic Risotto
===============

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
-  1 onion, chopped
-  4 clove garlic, minced
-  2 cup Arborio rice
-  1 cup Italian white wine
-  8 cup real chicken broth, simmering hot
-  1 cup good quality Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, shredded
-  1 Tbsp (or so) of butter
-  a few sprigs of fresh thyme or any fresh herb, minced

Directions
----------

1. Lightly simmer the chicken broth in one pot as you make the risotto
   in another pot.
2. Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, then add in the
   onions and garlic. Saute until golden and fragrant, a few minutes.
   Add the rice and continue to cook and stir over medium high heat,
   coating the grains evenly with the oil, until the rice grains give
   off a toasty aroma and transform from pure white to almost entirely
   opaque.
3. Add in the white wine and stir frequently as the rice absorbs the
   liquid. Reduce your heat to low. Start adding the hot chicken stock
   in several additions, stirring frequently after each one and allowing
   the rice to absorb the broth. Continue to cook and stir the risotto
   until the rice is just tender or al dente (soft with an ever so
   slight bite to the center) and creamy. The Arborio rice will
   gradually release its starch and thicken the extra liquid into
   creaminess. Creamy is important if you’re going for authenticity!
   This will take about 20 minutes from when you start adding the
   liquid.
4. To finish stir in the Parmesan, butter and minced fresh herbs. Spoon
   into dishes piping hot and share.

Variations
----------

1. Cook 1 diced chorizo before step 2 in the pan. Remove choizo and set
   aside. In step 2 use rendered fat in place of some of the olive oil.
   Re-add chorico when adding last batch of liquid in step 3. Add 1 cup
   of cooked peas in step 4 instead of herbs.
2. Add chopped meat from 1 lobster tail to risotto mixture in step 3
   half way through adding the liquids.

Mushroom Risotto
================

Source: `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/922-mushroom-risotto>`__

Ingredients
-----------
- 2 bay leaves
- 6 sprigs fresh thyme
- 4 sprigs fresh parsley leaves
- 1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms, rinsed in mesh strainer under running water
- 3 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 1/4 pounds cremini mushrooms, wiped clean with a paper towel, stems discarded, and caps cut into fourths if small or sixths if medium or large
- 2 medium onions, chopped fine (2 cups)
- Salt
- 3 medium cloves garlic, pressed through garlic press or minced (about 1 tablespoon)
- 1 pound Arborio rice (2 1/8 cups)
- 1 cup dry white wine or dry vermouth
- 2 ounces Parmesan cheese, finely grated (about 1 cup)
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves
- Ground black pepper

Directions
----------
1. Tie together bay leaves, thyme sprigs, and parsley sprigs with kitchen
   twine. Bring bundled herbs, porcini mushrooms, chicken broth, soy sauce,
   and 3 1/2 cups water to boil in medium saucepan over medium-high heat;
   reduce to medium-low and simmer until dried mushrooms are softened and
   fully hydrated, about 15 minutes. Remove and discard herb bundle and
   strain broth through fine-mesh strainer set over medium bowl (you should
   have about 6 1/2 cups strained liquid); return liquid to saucepan and
   keep warm over low heat. Finely mince porcini and set aside.
2. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Heat
   2 tablespoons butter in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.
   When foaming subsides, add cremini mushrooms, 1 cup onions, and
   1/2 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring occasionally, until moisture released
   by mushrooms evaporates and mushrooms are well browned, about 7 minutes.
   Stir in garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute, then transfer mushrooms
   to oven-safe bowl and keep warm in oven. Off heat, add 1/4 cup water to
   now-empty skillet and scrape with wooden spoon to loosen any browned
   bits; pour liquid from skillet into saucepan with broth.
3. Heat 3 tablespoons butter in large saucepan over medium heat. When
   foaming subsides, add remaining 1 cup onions and 1/4 teaspoon salt; cook,
   stirring occasionally, until onions are softened and translucent, about
   9 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring frequently, until grains’ edges
   are transparent, about 4 minutes. Add wine and cook, stirring frequently,
   until rice absorbs wine. Add minced porcini and 3 1/2 cups broth and cook,
   stirring every 2 to 3 minutes, until liquid is absorbed, 9 to 11 minutes.
   Stir in additional 1/2 cup broth every 2 to 3 minutes until rice is
   cooked through but grains are still somewhat firm at center,
   10 to 12 minutes (rice may not require all of broth). Stir in remaining
   1 tablespoon butter, then stir in mushrooms (and any accumulated juices),
   Parmesan, and chopped parsley. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper;
   serve immediately in warmed bowls.

   <p style="page-break-before: always"/>

Directions
----------

1. Toss meat, seafood, or tofu with soy sauce and sherry in medium bowl;
   set aside. Combine all sauce ingredients in a second small bowl.
   Divide vegetables into two or three batches according to ingredient
   list.
2. Heat 12- or 14-inch nonstick skillet over high heat, 4 minutes (pan
   should be so hot, you can hold your outstretched hand 1 inch above
   its surface for no more than 3 seconds); add 1 tablespoon oil (add 2
   tablespoons for tofu or fish) and rotate pan so that bottom is evenly
   coated. Let oil heat until it just starts to shimmer and smoke. Check
   heat with hand. Drain meat, seafood, or tofu, then add to pan and
   stir-fry until seared and about three-quarters cooked (about 20
   seconds for fish, 60 seconds for meat, 2 minutes for tofu, 2 1/2 to 3
   minutes for chicken). Spoon cooked meat or seafood into serving dish.
   Cover and keep warm.
3. Let pan come back up to temperature, 1 or 2 minutes. When hot,
   drizzle in 2 teaspoons of oil, and when oil just starts to smoke, add
   vegetables from first category. Stir-fry until vegetables are just
   tender-crisp, about 2 minutes. Leaving first batch in pan, repeat
   with remaining vegetables, cooking each set of vegetables until
   tender-crisp, or for fourth category, wilted. Add about a teaspoon of
   oil for each new batch (amount of oil will depend on skillet you are
   using-nonstick pans require about a teaspoon; other pans may require
   2 teaspoons). Clear center of pan and add garlic, ginger, and
   scallions. Drizzle with 1/2 teaspoon of oil. Mash into pan with back
   of a spatula. Cook for 10 seconds. Remove pan from heat and stir
   garlic/ginger mixture into vegetables for 20 seconds.
4. Return pan to heat and add cooked meat, seafood, or tofu. Stir in
   sauce and stir-fry to coat all ingredients, about 1 minute. Serve
   immediately with rice.

Homemade Pizza Dough
====================

+--------------------+----------------+
| Prep Time: 2 hours | Yield: 1 pound |
+--------------------+----------------+

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 cups (11 ounce or 311g) bread flour, plus extra for work surface
-  1 teaspoon instant or rapid rise yeast
-  3/4 teaspoon salt
-  2 tablespoons olive oil, plus extra for bowl
-  1 cup warm water

Directions
----------

1. Pulse the flour, yeast, and salt in a food processor (fitted with
   dough blade if possible) to combine. With the food processor running,
   pour the oil, then the water through the feed tube and process until
   a rough ball forms, 30 to 40 seconds. Let the dough rest in the bowl
   for 2 minutes, then process for 30 seconds longer.
2. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead by
   hand to form a smooth, round ball, about 5 minutes, adding additional
   flour as needed to prevent the dough from sticking. Transfer to a
   lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm
   place until doubled in size, 1 to 1/2 hours,
3. Gently deflate the dough with your fist and turn it out onto an
   unfloured work surface. Gently reshape the dough into a ball and
   cover with plastic wrap lightly sprayed with vegetable oil spray. Let
   the dough rest for 15 minutes, but no more than 30 minutes, before
   shaping.

Source: Combination of recipres from `Cooks Country <https://www.cookscountry.com/recipes/6637-slow-cooker-stuffed-peppers>`__
and `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/225-classic-stuffed-bell-peppers>`__

Ingredients
-----------
- 4 red, yellow, or orange bell peppers
- 1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 3/4 cup Arborio rice
- 8 ounces (225g) hot Italian sausage, casings removed
- 1	medium onion, chopped fine (about 1 cup)
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
- Salt and pepper
- 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1 can, 14 1/2 ounce (428ml), crushed tomatoes
- 2 1/2 ounces (70g) Parmesan cheese, grated (1 1/4 cups)

Directions
----------
1. Bring 4 quarts water to boil in large stockpot or Dutch oven over high
   heat. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350°F.
2. While water is coming to a boil, cut off top 1/2 inch of bell peppers.
   Discard stem and seeds. Chop pepper tops into 1/4-inch pieces; reserve
   pepper cups. Add 1 tablespoon salt and bell peppers. Cook until peppers
   just begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, remove peppers
   from pot, drain off excess water, and place peppers cut-sides up on
   paper towels.
3. Microwave broth and rice in covered large bowl until liquid is absorbed
   and rice is nearly tender, 10 to 13 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, cook sausage in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high
   heat, breaking up meat into small pieces, until browned, 6 to 8 minutes.
   Using slotted spoon, transfer sausage to paper towel–lined plate.
5. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from skillet. Add onions and chopped
   pepper and cook until browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in garlic, oregano,
   1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/8 teaspoon pepper, and pepper flakes and cook until

Ingredients
-----------
Peppers and Stuffing
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 medium onion, chopped fine
- 8 ounces (225g) ground beef, preferably 85 percent lean
- 4 ounces (113g) hot or mild Italian sausage, casings removed
- Salt and pepper
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 cups cooked long-grain rice
- 1 can, 14.5 ounce (428ml), diced tomatoes, drained
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves
- 4 medium red bell peppers, cut in half through stem end (stem left intact), cored, and seeded

For Serving
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and pepper
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions
----------
1. For the peppers: Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat until
   shimmering. Cook onion until softened and beginning to brown, about
   5 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high and add beef, sausage,
   1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; cook, breaking meat into
   small pieces with wooden spoon, until meat begins to brown,
   6 to 8 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
   Drain mixture in colander for 1 minute.
2. Transfer meat mixture to large bowl and mix with rice, tomatoes,
   mozzarella, Parmesan, parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
   Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 20 minutes.
3. Spoon filling evenly into bell peppers. Wrap each pepper with 2 layers of
   plastic wrap and 1 layer of foil. Place in baking dish and freeze until
   firm. Transfer to zipper-lock plastic bag and freeze up to 2 months.
4. When ready to serve: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to
   450 degrees. Cut 8 pieces foil large enough to just cover stuffing in
   peppers, and spray with cooking spray. Unwrap peppers and cover filling
   sides with new foil squares. Using skewer, poke several holes through foil.
   Place peppers, foil side down, over vents of slotted broiler-pan top set
   over broiler-pan bottom. Brush peppers with oil and season with salt and
   pepper to taste. Bake until peppers are spotty brown, 30 to 35 minutes.
   Flip peppers filling side up, remove foil, and sprinkle with mozzarella.
   Bake until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Let rest 5 minutes before
   serving.

Variation
---------
For a vegetarian version replace beef and pork with 1 can, 15 ounce (443ml),
cannellini beans, drained and rinsed.  In step 1 add garlic to onions and
cook as instructed then stir in beans.
