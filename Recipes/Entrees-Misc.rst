Grilled Rack of Lamb
====================

+----------------------+-------------------------+-------------------+
| Prep Time: 5 minutes | Cooking Time: 8 minutes | Yield: 2 servings |
+----------------------+-------------------------+-------------------+

Ingredients
-----------

-  1 rack lamb separated into individual chops
-  4 cloves garlic, crushed
-  1 teaspoon salt
-  1/4 cup dijon mustard
-  2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
-  3 teaspoons fresh rosemary, chopped
-  2 tablespoons lemon juice

Paella on the Grill
===================

This recipe shortened the outdoor cooking time by using roasted red
peppers and tomato paste (instead of fresh peppers and tomatoes), making
an infused broth with the seasonings, and grilling (rather than searing)
the chicken thighs. This also deliberately places the chicken on the
perimeter of the pan, where it would finish cooking gently after
grilling, and the sausage and seafood in the center, where they were
partially submerged in the liquid so that they cooked through; once the
liquid reduced, the steam kept them warm.

Ingredients
-----------

-  1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed and halved
   crosswise
-  Salt and pepper
-  12 ounces jumbo shrimp (16 to 20 per pound), peeled and deveined
-  6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
-  6 garlic cloves, minced
-  1 3/4 teaspoons hot smoked paprika
-  3 tablespoons tomato paste
-  4 cups chicken broth
-  1 (8-ounce) bottle clam juice
-  2/3 cup dry sherry
-  Pinch saffron threads (optional)
-  1 onion, chopped fine
-  1/2 cup jarred roasted red peppers, chopped fine
-  3 cups Arborio rice
-  1 pound littleneck clams, scrubbed
-  1 pound Spanish-style chorizo sausage, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
-  1 cup frozen peas, thawed
-  Lemon wedges

Directions
----------

1. Place chicken on large plate and sprinkle both sides with 1 teaspoon
   salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Toss shrimp with 1 tablespoon oil, 1/2
   teaspoon garlic, 1/4 teaspoon paprika, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in bowl
   until evenly coated. Set aside.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in medium saucepan over medium heat until
   shimmering. Add remaining garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until
   garlic sticks to bottom of saucepan and begins to brown, about 1
   minute. Add tomato paste and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons paprika and
   continue to cook, stirring constantly, until dark brown bits form on
   bottom of saucepan, about 1 minute. Add broth, clam juice, sherry,
   and saffron, if using. Increase heat to high and bring to boil.
   Remove saucepan from heat and set aside.
3. Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15
   minutes. Leave all burners on high.
4. Clean and oil cooking grate. Place chicken on grill and cook until
   both sides are lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes total. Return chicken
   to plate. Clean cooking grate.
5. Place roasting pan on grill (turning burners to medium-high if using
   gas) and add remaining 1/4 cup oil. When oil begins to shimmer, add
   onion, red peppers, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring frequently,
   until onion begins to brown, 4 to 7 minutes. Add rice (turning
   burners to medium) and stir until grains are well coated with oil.
6. Arrange chicken around perimeter of pan. Pour broth mixture and any
   accumulated juices from chicken over rice. Smooth rice into even
   layer, making sure nothing sticks to sides of pan and no rice rests
   atop chicken. When liquid reaches gentle simmer, place shrimp in
   center of pan in single layer. Arrange clams in center of pan, evenly
   distributing with shrimp and pushing hinge sides of clams into rice
   slightly so they stand up. Distribute chorizo evenly over surface of
   rice. Cook covered, moving and rotating pan to maintain gentle simmer
   across entire surface of pan, until rice is almost cooked through, 12
   to 18 minutes. (Heat can also be adjusted to maintain simmer.)
7. Sprinkle peas evenly over paella, cover grill, and cook until liquid
   is fully absorbed and rice on bottom of pan sizzles, 5 to 8 minutes.
   Continue to cook, uncovered, checking bottom of pan frequently with
   metal spoon, until uniform golden-brown crust forms, 8 to 15 minutes
   longer. (Rotate and slide pan around grill as necessary to ensure
   even crust formation.) Remove pan from grill, cover with aluminum
   foil, and let stand for 10 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges.

Cast Iron Paella
================

A traditional stainless-steel pan would have to sit over high heat for
the last 5 minutes of cooking to develop this crust, which creates a
high risk of the more delicate ingredients overcooking, but the
cast-iron pan, with its high heat retention, naturally created the crust
during the course of cooking the recipe without any extra steps.

Ingredients
-----------

-  12 oz extra large shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), peeled and deveined
-  9 garlic cloves, minced
-  3 tablespoons vegetable oil
-  Salt and pepper
-  12 oz boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed and halved crosswise
-  8 oz Spanish-style chorizo sausage, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
-  1 red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and chopped fine
-  1 onion, chopped fine
-  2 1/4 cups Arborio rice
-  1/2 teaspoon saffron threads
-  1 (14.5 oz) can diced tomatoes, drained
-  2 1/4 cups chicken broth
-  1/4 cup dry white wine
-  12 mussels, scrubbed and debearded
-  1/2 cup frozen peas, thawed
-  Lemon wedges

Directions
----------

1. Toss shrimp with 1 teaspoon garlic and 1 tablespoon oil and season
   with salt and pepper; set aside. Pat chicken dry with paper towels
   and season with salt and pepper. Heat 12-inch cast-iron skillet over
   medium heat for 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon oil and heat until just
   smoking. Brown chicken on all sides, about 6 minutes; transfer to
   bowl.
2. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in now-empty skillet until
   shimmering. Add chorizo, bell pepper, onion, and 1/4 teaspoon salt
   and cook until vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in
   rice, saffron, and remaining garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30
   seconds. Stir in tomatoes and cook until mixture begins to darken and
   thicken slightly, about 3 minutes. Stir in broth and wine, scraping
   up any browned bits, and bring to simmer.
3. Nestle chicken into skillet. Reduce heat to gentle simmer, cover, and
   cook until most of liquid is absorbed and rice is al dente, about 15
   minutes.
4. Insert mussels hinged side down into rice (so they stand upright) and
   scatter shrimp over top. Cover and cook until shrimp are opaque
   throughout and mussels have opened, 6 to 8 minutes.
5. Off heat, discard any mussels that refuse to open. Scatter peas over
   rice, cover, and let sit until heated through, about 5 minutes. Serve
   immediately with lemon wedges.

Classic Risotto
===============

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
-  1 onion, chopped
-  4 clove garlic, minced
-  2 cup Arborio rice
-  1 cup Italian white wine
-  8 cup real chicken broth, simmering hot
-  1 cup good quality Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, shredded
-  1 Tbsp (or so) of butter
-  a few sprigs of fresh thyme or any fresh herb, minced

Directions
----------

1. Lightly simmer the chicken broth in one pot as you make the risotto
   in another pot.
2. Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, then add in the
   onions and garlic. Saute until golden and fragrant, a few minutes.
   Add the rice and continue to cook and stir over medium high heat,
   coating the grains evenly with the oil, until the rice grains give
   off a toasty aroma and transform from pure white to almost entirely
   opaque.
3. Add in the white wine and stir frequently as the rice absorbs the
   liquid. Reduce your heat to low. Start adding the hot chicken stock
   in several additions, stirring frequently after each one and allowing
   the rice to absorb the broth. Continue to cook and stir the risotto
   until the rice is just tender or al dente (soft with an ever so
   slight bite to the center) and creamy. The Arborio rice will
   gradually release its starch and thicken the extra liquid into
   creaminess. Creamy is important if youâre going for authenticity!
   This will take about 20 minutes from when you start adding the
   liquid.
4. To finish stir in the Parmesan, butter and minced fresh herbs. Spoon
   into dishes piping hot and share.

Variations
----------

1. Cook 1 diced chorizo before step 2 in the pan. Remove choizo and set
   aside. In step 2 use rendered fat in place of some of the olive oil.
   Re-add chorico when adding last batch of liquid in step 3. Add 1 cup
   of cooked peas in step 4 instead of herbs.
2. Add chopped meat from 1 lobster tail to risotto mixture in step 3
   half way through adding the liquids.

-  1/3 cup panko bread crumbs
-  1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
-  Salt and pepper
-  2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions
----------

1. Bring water and milk to boil in medium saucepan over high heat. Stir
   in macaroni and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring frequently,
   until macaroni is soft (slightly past al dente), 6 to 8 minutes. Add
   velveeta, mustard, and cayenne and cook, stirring constantly, until
   cheese is completely melted, about 1 minute. Off heat, stir in
   cheddar until evenly distributed but not melted. Cover saucepan and
   let stand for 5 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, combine panko, oil, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon
   pepper in 8-inch nonstick skillet until panko is evenly moistened.
   Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until evenly browned, 3
   to 4 minutes. Off heat, sprinkle Parmesan over panko mixture and stir
   to combine. Transfer panko mixture to small bowl.

   PageBreak recipePage

Directions
----------

1. Toss meat, seafood, or tofu with soy sauce and sherry in medium bowl;
   set aside. Combine all sauce ingredients in a second small bowl.
   Divide vegetables into two or three batches according to ingredient
   list.
2. Heat 12- or 14-inch nonstick skillet over high heat, 4 minutes (pan
   should be so hot, you can hold your outstretched hand 1 inch above
   its surface for no more than 3 seconds); add 1 tablespoon oil (add 2
   tablespoons for tofu or fish) and rotate pan so that bottom is evenly
   coated. Let oil heat until it just starts to shimmer and smoke. Check
   heat with hand. Drain meat, seafood, or tofu, then add to pan and
   stir-fry until seared and about three-quarters cooked (about 20
   seconds for fish, 60 seconds for meat, 2 minutes for tofu, 2 1/2 to 3
   minutes for chicken). Spoon cooked meat or seafood into serving dish.
   Cover and keep warm.
3. Let pan come back up to temperature, 1 or 2 minutes. When hot,
   drizzle in 2 teaspoons of oil, and when oil just starts to smoke, add
   vegetables from first category. Stir-fry until vegetables are just
   tender-crisp, about 2 minutes. Leaving first batch in pan, repeat
   with remaining vegetables, cooking each set of vegetables until
   tender-crisp, or for fourth category, wilted. Add about a teaspoon of
   oil for each new batch (amount of oil will depend on skillet you are
   using-nonstick pans require about a teaspoon; other pans may require
   2 teaspoons). Clear center of pan and add garlic, ginger, and

Old-Fashioned Stuffed Turkey
============================

Ingredients
-----------

Turkey
^^^^^^

-  1 turkey (12 to 15 pounds), giblets and neck reserved for gravy, if
   making
-  3 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons kosher salt
-  2 teaspoons baking powder
-  12 ounces salt pork, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices and rinsed

Stuffing
^^^^^^^^

-  1 1/2 pounds white sandwich bread (about 15 slices), cut into
   1/2-inch cubes (about 12 cups)
-  4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus extra for baking dish
-  1 medium onion, chopped fine (about 1 cup)
-  2 celery ribs, chopped fine (about 1 cup)
-  Kosher salt and ground black pepper
-  2 tablespoons minced fresh thyme leaves
-  1 tablespoon minced fresh marjoram leaves
-  1 tablespoon minced fresh sage leaves
-  1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
-  1 36-inch square cheesecloth, folded in quarters
-  2 large eggs

Directions
----------

1. FOR THe TURKeY: Using fingers or handle of wooden spoon, separate
   turkey skin from meat on breast, legs, thighs, and back; avoid
   breaking skin. Rub 1 tablespoon salt evenly inside cavity of turkey,
   1 1/2 teaspoons salt under skin of each breast, and 1 1/2 teaspoons
   salt under skin of each leg. Wrap turkey tightly with plastic wrap;
   refrigerate 24 to 48 hours.
2. FOR THe STUFFING: Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven
   to 250Â°F. Spread bread cubes in single layer on baking sheet; bake
   until edges have dried but centers are slightly moist (cubes should
   yield to pressure), about 45 minutes, stirring several times during
   baking. Transfer to large bowl and increase oven temperature to
   325Â°F.
3. While bread dries, heat 4 tablespoons butter in 12-inch skillet over
   medium-high heat; when foaming subsides, add onion, celery, 2
   teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper; cook, stirring occasionally,
   until vegetables begin to soften and brown slightly, 7 to 10 minutes.
   Stir in herbs; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add vegetables to
   bowl with dried bread; add 1 cup broth and toss until evenly
   moistened.

4. TO ROAST THe TURKeY: Combine remaining 2 teaspoons kosher salt and
   baking powder in small bowl. Remove turkey from refrigerator and
   unwrap. Thoroughly dry inside and out with paper towels. Using
   skewer, poke 15 to 20 holes in fat deposits on top of breast halves
   and thighs, 4 to 5 holes in each deposit. Sprinkle surface of turkey
   with salt-baking powder mixture and rub in mixture with hands,
   coating skin evenly. Tuck wings underneath turkey. Line turkey cavity
   with cheesecloth, pack with 4 to 5 cups stuffing, tie ends of
   cheesecloth together. Cover remaining stuffing with plastic wrap and
   refrigerate. Using twine, loosely tie turkey legs together. Place
   turkey breast-side down in V-rack set in roasting pan and drape salt
   pork slices over back.
5. Roast turkey breast-side down until thickest part of breast registers
   130Â°F on instant-read thermometer, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Remove roasting
   pan from oven (close oven door) and increase oven temperature to
   450Â°F. Transfer turkey in V-rack to rimmed baking sheet. Remove and
   discard salt pork. Using clean potholders or kitchen towels, rotate
   turkey breast-side up. Cut twine binding legs and remove stuffing
   bag; empty into reserved stuffing in bowl. Pour drippings from
   roasting pan into fat separator and reserve for gravy, if making.
6. Once oven has come to temperature, return turkey in V-rack to

Homemade Pizza Dough
====================

+--------------------+----------------+
| Prep Time: 2 hours | Yield: 1 pound |
+--------------------+----------------+

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 cups (11 oz) bread flour, plus extra for work surface
-  1 teaspoon instant or rapid rise yeast
-  3/4 teaspoon salt
-  2 tablespoons olive oil, plus extra for bowl
-  1 cup warm water

Directions
----------

1. Pulse the flour, yeast, and salt in a food processor (fitted with
   dough blade if possible) to combine. With the food processor running,
   pour the oil, then the water through the feed tube and process until
   a rough ball forms, 30 to 40 seconds. Let the dough rest in the bowl
   for 2 minutes, then process for 30 seconds longer.
2. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead by
   hand to form a smooth, round ball, about 5 minutes, adding additional
   flour as needed to prevent the dough from sticking. Transfer to a
   lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm
   place until doubled in size, 1 to 1/2 hours,
3. Gently deflate the dough with your fist and turn it out onto an
   unfloured work surface. Gently reshape the dough into a ball and
   cover with plastic wrap lightly sprayed with vegetable oil spray. Let
   the dough rest for 15 minutes, but no more than 30 minutes, before
   shaping.

Tagliatelle with Bolognese Sauce
================================

+-----------------------+---------------------------+-------------------+
| Prep Time: 15 minutes | Cooking Time: 1 1/4 hours | Yield: 4 servings |
+-----------------------+---------------------------+-------------------+

Source: `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/9383-weeknight-tagliatelle-with-bolognese-sauce?extcode=MKSCZ00L0&ref=new_search_experience_2>`__

Ingredients
-----------
- 1 pound 93 percent lean ground beef
- 2 tablespoons water
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- Salt and pepper
- 4 cups beef broth
- 6 ounces pancetta, chopped coarse
- 1 onion, chopped coarse
- 1 large carrot, peeled and chopped coarse
- 1 celery rib, chopped coarse
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 cup dry red wine
- 1 ounce Parmesan cheese, grated (1/2 cup), plus extra for serving
- 1 pound tagliatelle (can substitute papardelle or fettuccine)

Directions
----------
1. Toss beef with water, baking soda, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in bowl until
   thoroughly combined. Set aside.
2. While beef sits, bring broth to boil over high heat in large pot (this pot
   will be used to cook pasta in step 6) and cook until reduced to 2 cups,
   about 15 minutes; set aside.
3. Pulse pancetta in food processor until finely chopped, 15 to 20 pulses.
   Add onion, carrot, and celery and pulse until vegetables are finely chopped
   and mixture has paste-like consistency, 12 to 15 pulses, scraping down
   sides of bowl as needed.
4. Heat butter and oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until
   shimmering. When foaming subsides, add pancetta-vegetable mixture and
   1/4 teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has
   evaporated, about 8 minutes. Spread mixture in even layer in bottom of pot
   and continue to cook, stirring every couple of minutes, until very dark
   browned bits form on bottom of pot, 7 to 12 minutes longer. Stir in tomato
   paste and cook until paste is rust-colored and bottom of pot is dark brown,
   1 to 2 minutes.
5. Reduce heat to medium, add beef, and cook, using wooden spoon to break meat
   into pieces no larger than 1/4 inch, until beef has just lost its raw pink
   color, 4 to 7 minutes. Stir in wine, scraping up any browned bits, and
   bring to simmer. Cook until wine has evaporated and sauce has thickened,
   about 5 minutes. Stir in broth and Parmesan. Return sauce to simmer; cover,
   reduce heat to low, and simmer for 30 minutes (sauce will look thin).
   Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper to taste.
6. Rinse pot that held broth. While sauce simmers, bring 4 quarts water to
   boil in now-empty pot. Add pasta and 1 tablespoon salt and cook, stirring
   occasionally, until al dente. Reserve 1/4 cup cooking water, then drain
   pasta. Add pasta to pot with sauce and toss to combine. Adjust sauce
   consistency with reserved cooking water as needed. Transfer to platter or
   individual bowls and serve, passing extra Parmesan separately.
