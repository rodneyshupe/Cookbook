Homemade Bacon
==============

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 1/2 pounds pork belly, squared off, rind removed
-  2 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt
-  1/2 teaspoon instacure no. 1 (prague powder no. 1)
-  1/4 cup brown sugar (possible substitutions maple syrup, honey, white
   sugar or molasses)
-  2 tablespoons bourbon (possible substitution apple cider)

Directions
----------

1. Place the pork belly in a large Ziploc bag. Add the salt and pink
   salt and the cure additions. Rub the cure into the pork belly,
   turning the bag over and over and pressing the cure into the flesh.
2. Close the bag, squeezing out all the air and refrigerate for seven
   days. each day, flip the bag over. Some liquid will begin to gather
   in the bag.
3. After seven days, wash the cure off the meat, rinsing thoroughly. Pat
   the bacon dry with paper towels and set it on a rack over a baking
   sheet. Allow the bacon to air-dry in the refrigerator for 6 to 24
   hours.
4. Preheat the smoker to 200°F. Smoke for about 2 hours (or to an
   internal temperature of 150°F) with Apple (or Maple) wood.
5. Chill the bacon well, then slice thick or thin, to preference. Any
   bacon that doesn’t easily slice may be cut into chunks, for starting
   a pot of beans or soup.
6. Wrapped in parchment paper, then wrapped in plastic wrap or foil and
   placed in a Ziploc bag, the bacon will keep for three weeks in the
   refrigerator and three months in the freezer.

Note
----

If not using a smoker perform step 3 in a oven and add 1/2 tablespoon of
liquid smoke to cure.
