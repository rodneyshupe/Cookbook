Note
----

If you want a really sweet Indian Candy, glaze the salmon with the
following syrup. Heat 4oz red wine and 4oz dark rum, in a sauce pan. Add
2cups brown sugar, 1cup honey, (or maple syrup), stir until dissolved.
Freshly ground pepper or cayenne may be added if you prefer a little
extra spiciness. Glaze may be brushed on several or more times during
the smoking process. Alternately, you may remove salmon from smoker
halfway through smoking and soak fish for several hours before resuming
smoking.
