Chili
=====

+-----------------------+-----------------------+---------------------+
| Prep Time: 30 minutes | Cooking Time: 3 hours | Yield: 6-8 servings |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+---------------------+


Ingredients
-----------

-  kosher salt
-  1/2 pound, dried pinto beans (about 1 cup) - rinsed and picked over
-  6 dried ancho chiles (about 1 3/4 ounces) - stems and seeds removed,
   and flesh torn into 1-inch pieces
-  2-4 dried arbol chiles - stems removed, pods split, seeds removed
-  3 tablespoons, cornmeal
-  2 teaspoons, dried oregano
-  2 teaspoons, ground cumin
-  2 teaspoons, unsweetened cocoa powder
-  2 1/2 cups, chicken broth (divided use)
-  2 medium onions - cut into 3/4-inch pieces (about 2 cups)
-  3 small jalapeno chiles - stems and seeds removed and discarded,
   flesh cut into 1/2-inch pieces
-  3 tablespoons, vegetable oil
-  4 medium garlic cloves - minced or pressed through garlic press
   (about 4 teaspoons)
-  1 (14.5 ounce) can, diced tomatoes
-  2 teaspoons, light molasses
-  3 1/2 pounds, blade steak, 3/4 inch thick - trimmed of gristle and
   fat and cut into 3/4-inch pieces
-  1 (12-ounce) bottle, mild lager beer (such as Budweiser)

Directions
----------

1. In a large Dutch oven, combine 4 tablespoons of salt, 4 quarts of
   water, and the beans and bring to boil over high heat. Remove the pot
   from heat, cover, and allow the beans to stand for 1 hour. Drain and
   rinse the beans well.
2. Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and pre-heat the
   oven to 300°F.
3. Place the ancho chiles in 12-inch skillet set over medium-high heat;
   toast them,stirring frequently, until flesh is fragrant, 4 to 6
   minutes - reducing the heat if chiles begin to smoke. Transfer the
   toasted chiles to the bowl of food processor and allow them to cool.
   Do not wash out the skillet.
4. To the food processor containing the toasted ancho chiles, add the
   àrbol chiles,cornmeal, oregano, cumin, cocoa, and 3/4 teaspoon salt.
   Process until finely ground - about 2 minutes. With the processor
   running, very slowly add 1/2 cup of the broth through the feed tube,
   until a smooth paste forms - about 45 seconds,scraping down the sides
   of the bowl as necessary. Transfer the paste to a small bowl and set
   aside. Place the onions in the now-empty processor bowl and pulse
   until roughly chopped - about four 1-second pulses. Add the jalapenos
   and pulse until the mixture has the consistency of chunky salsa -
   about four 1-second pulses - scraping down the bowl as necessary.
5. In a large Dutch oven, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat.
   Add the onion mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until moisture
   has evaporated and vegetables are softened - 7 to 9 minutes. Add the
   garlic and cook until fragrant -about 1 minute. Add the reserved
   chili paste, the tomatoes, and the molasses. Stir until the chili
   paste is thoroughly combined with the other ingredients. Add the
   remaining 2 cups broth and the drained beans; bring to a boil, then
   reduce the heat to simmer.
6. Meanwhile, in the 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1
   tablespoon oil until it is shimmering. Pat the pieces of beef dry
   with paper towels and sprinkle them with 11/2 teaspoons of salt.
7. To the skillet, add half of the beef and cook until browned on all
   sides - about10 minutes. Transfer the meat to the Dutch oven. Add 1/2
   of the bottle of lager to the skillet, scraping bottom of pan to
   loosen any browned bits, and bring to a simmer. Transfer the lager to
   the Dutch oven. Repeat with the remaining tablespoon oil, beef
   pieces, and lager. (Heat the oil, brown the beef, transfer the beef
   to the Dutch oven, add lager to the skillet, bring it to a simmer,
   and add the simmering beer to the Dutch oven.) Once the last addition
   of lager has been added to the Dutch oven, stir to combine the
   ingredients and return the mixture to a simmer.
8. Cover the pot and transfer to the preheated oven. Cook until the meat
   and beans are fully tender - 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Allow the chili to
   stand uncovered for 10minutes. Stir well and season to taste with
   salt before serving.


Notes
-----

-  A 4-pound chuck-eye roast, well trimmed of fat, can be substituted
   for the steak.
-  Because much of the chili flavor is held in the fat of this dish,
   refrain from skimming fat from the surface.
-  Wear gloves when working with both dried and fresh chiles.
-  Dried New Mexican or guajillo chiles make a good substitute for the
   anchos; each dried arbol may be substituted with 1/8 teaspoon
   cayenne. If you prefer not to work with any whole dried chiles, the
   anchos and àrbols can be replaced with 1/2 cup commercial chili
   powder and 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, though the texture of
   the chili will be slightly compromised.
-  Good choices for condiments include diced avocado, chopped red onion,
   chopped cilantro leaves, lime wedges, sour cream, and shredded
   Monterey Jack or cheddar cheese.
-  The chili can be made up to 3 days in advance.

Chicken and Dumplings Stew
==========================

+-----------------------+---------------------------------+-------------------+
| Prep Time: 20 minutes | Cooking Time: 1 hour 45 minutes | Yield: 6 servings |
+-----------------------+---------------------------------+-------------------+


Ingredients
-----------

Stew
^^^^

- 6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 2 1/2 pounds), trimmed of excess fat (see note)
- table salt and ground black pepper
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
- 2 small onions, chopped fine (about 1 1/2 cups)
- 2 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch pieces (about 2 cups)
- 1 celery rib, medium, chopped fine (about 1/2 cup)
- 1/4 cup dry sherry
- 6 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves
- 1 pound chicken wings (see note)
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves

Dumplings
^^^^^^^^^

- 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour (10 ounces)
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon table salt
- 1/4 cup buttermilk, cold (see note)
- 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted and cooled about 5 minutes
- 1 large egg white

Directions
----------

1. FOR THE STEW Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towels and season with
   1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Heat oil in large Dutch oven over
   medium-high heat until shimmering. Add chicken thighs, skin-side down, and
   cook until skin is crisp and well browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Using tongs,
   turn chicken pieces and brown on second side, 5 to 7 minutes longer;
   transfer to large plate. Discard all but 1 teaspoon fat from pot.
2. Add onions, carrots, and celery to now-empty pot; cook, stirring
   occasionally, until caramelized, 7 to 9 minutes. Stir in sherry, scraping
   up any browned bits. Stir in broth and thyme. Return chicken thighs, with
   any accumulated juices, to pot and add chicken wings. Bring to simmer,
   cover, and cook until thigh meat offers no resistance when poked with tip
   of paring knife but still clings to bones, 45 to 55 minutes.
3. Remove pot from heat and transfer chicken to cutting board. Allow broth to
   settle 5 minutes, then skim fat from surface using wide spoon or ladle.
   When cool enough to handle, remove and discard skin from chicken. Using
   fingers or fork, pull meat from chicken thighs (and wings, if desired) and
   cut into 1-inch pieces. Return meat to pot.
4. FOR THE DUMPLINGS Whisk flour, baking soda, sugar, and salt in large bowl.
   Combine buttermilk and melted butter in medium bowl, stirring until butter
   forms small clumps; whisk in egg white. Add buttermilk mixture to dry
   ingredients and stir with rubber spatula until just incorporated and
   batter pulls away from sides of bowl.
5. Return stew to simmer; stir in parsley and season with salt and pepper to
   taste. Using greased tablespoon measure (or #60 portion scoop), scoop
   level amount of batter and drop over top of stew, spacing about 1/4 inch
   apart (you should have about 24 dumplings). Wrap lid of Dutch oven with
   clean kitchen towel (keeping towel away from heat source) and cover pot.
   Simmer gently until dumplings have doubled in size and toothpick inserted
   into center comes out clean, 13 to 16 minutes. Serve immediately.

Notes
-----
We strongly recommend buttermilk for the dumplings, but it’s acceptable to
substitute 1/2 cup plain yogurt thinned with 1/4 cup milk. If you want to
include white meat (and don’t mind losing a bit of flavor in the process),
replace 2 chicken thighs with 2 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
(about 8 ounces each). Brown the chicken breasts along with the thighs and
remove them from the stew once they reach an internal temperature of
160 degrees, 20 to 30 minutes. The collagen in the wings helps thicken the
stew; do not omit or substitute. Since the wings yield only about 1 cup of
meat, using their meat is optional. The stew can be prepared through
step 3 up to 2 days in advance; bring the stew back to a simmer before
proceeding with the recipe.

Coq Au Vin
==========

+-----------------------+--------------------------+---------------------+
| Prep Time: 30 minutes | Cooking Time: 90 minutes | Yield: 4-6 servings |
+-----------------------+--------------------------+---------------------+


Ingredients
-----------

-  1 bottle fruity, smooth, medium-bodied red wine (see note below)
-  2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
-  10 sprigs fresh flat leaf parsley leaves
-  2 tablespoons minced fresh flat leaf parsley leaves
-  2 sprigs fresh thyme
-  1 bay leaf
-  4 ounces bacon, preferably thick-cut, cut crosswise into 1/4-inch
   pieces
-  2 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed of excess fat
   and cut in half crosswise
-  Salt and ground black pepper
-  5 tablespoons unsalted butter
-  24°Frozen pearl onions, thawed, drained, and patted dry (about 1
   cup)\ *(see note below)*
-  8 ounces cremini mushrooms, wiped clean, stems trimmed, quartered
   *(halved if small)*
-  2 medium cloves garlic, minced or pressed through garlic press (about
   2 teaspoons)
-  1 tablespoon tomato paste
-  2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

Directions
----------

1. Bring all but 1 tablespoon wine (reserve for later use), broth,
   parsley sprigs, thyme, and bay to simmer in large saucepan over
   medium-high heat. Cook until reduced to 3 cups, about 25 minutes.
   Discard herbs.
2. Meanwhile, cook bacon in large Dutch oven over medium heat until
   browned, 7 to 8 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to
   paper-towel-lined plate. Reserve 2 tablespoons fat in small bowl;
   discard remaining fat.
3. Lightly season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon
   reserved bacon fat in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just
   smoking. Add half of chicken in single layer and cook until lightly
   browned, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to plate and repeat with
   remaining chicken and 1 tablespoon bacon fat.
4. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in now-empty Dutch oven over medium-high
   heat. When foaming subsides, add pearl onions and mushrooms; cook,
   stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Reduce
   heat to medium, add garlic, and cook until fragrant, about 30
   seconds. Add tomato paste and flour; cook, stirring frequently, until
   well combined, about 1 minute.
5. Add reduced wine mixture, scraping bottom of pot with wooden spoon to
   loosen browned bits; add 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Return chicken, any
   accumulated juices, and reserved bacon to pot; increase heat to high
   and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover pot, and simmer
   until chicken is tender, about 25 minutes, stirring halfway through
   cooking time.
6. Using slotted spoon, transfer chicken to large bowl; tent with foil
   to keep warm. Increase heat to medium-high and simmer sauce until
   thick and glossy and measures 3 cups, about 5 minutes. Off heat, stir
   in remaining 2 tablespoons butter and reserved 1 tablespoon wine.
   Season to taste with salt. Return chicken to pot and top with minced
   parsley. Serve immediately with egg noodles or mashed potatoes.


Notes
-----

A medium-bodied, fruity red wine such as Pinot Noir or Rhône Valley
Grenache is best for this recipe. Avoid bold, heavily oaked red wine s
like Cabernet and light-bodied wines like Beaujolais.

To use fresh pearl onions, trim the root and stem end of each onion and
discard. Boil for 1 minute, shock in ice water, then peel a thin strip
from root to stem. Remove any remaining outer skin (it’s like peeling
off a jacket). If neither frozen nor fresh pearl onions are available,
substitute one large onion cut into 1/2-inch pieces. (Do not use jarred
pearl onions, which will turn mushy and disintegrate into the sauce.)

   drumsticks, with breasts cut in half), trimmed of excess fat
-  Table salt and ground black pepper
-  2 tablespoons olive oil

-  3 cups low-sodium chicken broth
-  1 strip orange zest (from 1 orange), removed with vegetable peeler,
   about 3 inches long, cleaned of white pith
-  1/4 cup pastis or Pernod (see note)
-  3/4 pound Yukon Gold potato (1 large or 2 small), cut into 3/4-inch
   cubes
-  1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon leaves or parsley leaves

Rouille and Croutons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  3 tablespoons water
-  1/4 teaspoon saffron threads
-  1 baguette
-  4 teaspoons juice from 1 lemon
-  2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
-  1 large egg yolk
-  1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
-  2 small cloves garlic, minced or pressed through garlic press (about
   1 1/2 teaspoons)
-  1/2 cup vegetable oil
-  1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
-  Table salt and ground black pepper

Directions
----------

1. *For the Bouillabaisse:* Adjust oven racks to middle and lower
   positions and heat oven to 375°F. Pat chicken dry with paper
   towels and season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in large Dutch oven
   over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add chicken pieces,
   skin-side down, and cook without moving until well browned, 5 to 8
   minutes. Using tongs, flip chicken and brown other side, about 3
   minutes. Transfer chicken to large plate.
2. Add leek and fennel; cook, stirring often, until vegetables begin to
   soften and turn translucent, about 4 minutes. Add saffron, cayenne,
   flour, garlic, and tomato paste and cook until fragrant, about 30
   seconds. Add tomatoes, wine, broth, orange zest, pastis, and
   potatoes; bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 10
   minutes.
3. Nestle chicken thighs and drumsticks into simmering liquid with skin
   above surface of liquid; cook, uncovered, 5 minutes. Nestle breast
   pieces into simmering liquid, adjusting pieces as necessary to ensure
   skin stays above surface of liquid. Bake on middle rack, uncovered,
   until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of chicken
   registers 145°F for breasts and 160°F for drumsticks and thighs,
   10 to 20 minutes.
4. *For the Rouille:* While chicken cooks, microwave water and saffron
   in medium microwave-safe bowl on high power until water is steaming,
   10 to 20 seconds. Allow to sit 5 minutes. Cut 3-inch piece off of
   baguette; remove and discard crust. Tear crustless bread into 1-inch
   chunks (you should have about 1 cup). Stir bread pieces and lemon
   juice into saffron-infused water; soak 5 minutes. Using whisk, mash
   soaked bread mixture until uniform paste forms, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk
   in mustard, egg yolk, cayenne, and garlic until smooth, about 15
   seconds. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in vegetable oil in
   steady stream until smooth mayonnaise-like consistency is reached,
   scraping down bowl as necessary. Slowly whisk in 1/2 cup olive oil in
   steady stream until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
5. *For the Croutons:* Cut remaining baguette into 3/4-inch-thick
   slices. Arrange slices in single layer on rimmed baking sheet.
   Drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and season with salt
   and pepper. Bake on lower rack until light golden brown (can be
   toasted while bouillabaisse is in oven), 10 to 15 minutes.
6. Remove bouillabaisse and croutons from oven and set oven to broil.
   Once heated, return bouillabaisse to oven and cook until chicken skin
   is crisp and instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of
   chicken registers 160°F for breasts and 175°F for drumsticks and
   thighs, 5 to 10 minutes (smaller pieces may cook faster than larger
   pieces; remove individual pieces as they reach temperature).
7. Transfer chicken pieces to large plate. Skim excess fat from broth.
   Stir tarragon into broth and season with salt and pepper. Transfer
   broth and potatoes to large shallow serving bowls and top with
   chicken pieces. Drizzle 1 tablespoon rouille over each portion and
   spread 1 teaspoon rouille on each crouton. Serve, floating 2 croutons
   in each bowl and passing remaining croutons and rouille separately.

French Onion Soup
=================

For the best flavor, make the soup a day or 2 in advance. Alternatively,
the onions can be prepared through step 1, cooled in the pot, and
refrigerated for up to 3 days before proceeding with the recipe.

+-----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------+
| Prep Time: 15 minutes | Cooking Time: 4 1/2 hours | Yield: 4-6 servings |
+-----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------+


Ingredients
-----------

-  3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 3 pieces
-  6 large yellow onions (about 4 pounds), halved and cut pole to pole
   into 1/4-inch-thick slices
-  Table salt
-  2 cups water, plus extra for deglazing
-  1/2 cup dry sherry
-  4 cups low-sodium chicken broth (see note)
-  2 cups beef broth (see note)
-  6 sprigs fresh thyme, tied with kitchen twine
-  1 bay leaf
-  Ground black pepper
-  1 small baguette, cut into 1/2-inch slices
-  8 ounces shredded Gruyere cheese (about 2 1/2 cups)

Directions
----------

1. For the soup: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven
   to 400°F. Generously spray inside of heavy-bottomed large (at least
   7-quart) Dutch oven with nonstick cooking spray. Place butter in pot
   and add onions and 1 teaspoon salt. Cook, covered, 1 hour (onions
   will be moist and slightly reduced in volume). Remove pot from oven
   and stir onions, scraping bottom and sides of pot. Return pot to oven
   with lid slightly ajar and continue to cook until onions are very
   soft and golden brown, 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours longer, stirring onions
   and scraping bottom and sides of pot after 1 hour.
2. Carefully remove pot from oven and place over medium-high heat. Using
   oven mitts to handle pot, cook onions, stirring frequently and
   scraping bottom and sides of pot, until liquid evaporates and onions
   brown, 15 to 20 minutes, reducing heat to medium if onions are
   browning too quickly. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, until
   pot bottom is coated with dark crust, 6 to 8 minutes, adjusting heat
   as necessary. (Scrape any fond that collects on spoon back into
   onions.) Stir in 1/4 cup water, scraping pot bottom to loosen crust,
   and cook until water evaporates and pot bottom has formed another
   dark crust, 6 to 8 minutes. Repeat process of deglazing 2 or 3 more
   times, until onions are very dark brown. Stir in sherry and cook,
   stirring frequently, until sherry evaporates, about 5 minutes.
3. Stir in broths, 2 cups water, thyme, bay leaf, and 1/2 teaspoon salt,
   scraping up any final bits of browned crust on bottom and sides of
   pot. Increase heat to high and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to low,
   cover, and simmer 30 minutes. Remove and discard herbs, then season
   with salt and pepper.
4. For the croutons: While soup simmers, arrange baguette slices in
   single layer on baking sheet and bake in 400°F oven until bread is
   dry, crisp, and golden at edges, about 10 minutes. Set aside.
5. To serve: Adjust oven rack 6 inches from broiler element and heat
   broiler. Set individual broiler-safe crocks on baking sheet and fill
   each with about 1 3/4 cups soup. Top each bowl with 1 or 2 baguette
   slices (do not overlap slices) and sprinkle evenly with Gruyere.
   Broil until cheese is melted and bubbly around edges, 3 to 5 minutes.
   Let cool 5 minutes before serving.


Notes
-----

To speed up the process you can use this short cut for step #1. Combine
onions and 1 teaspoon salt in large microwave-safe bowl and cover with
large microwave-safe plate (plate should completely cover bowl and not
rest on onions). Microwave on high power for 20 to 25 minutes until
onions are soft and wilted, stirring halfway through cooking. (Use oven
mitts to remove bowl from microwave and remove plate away from you to
avoid steam burn.) Drain onions (about 1/2 cup liquid should drain off).
Place Dutch oven over medium-high heat and melt butter before adding
wilted onions. Proceed with step #2. The soup’s flavor, however, will
not be quite as deep as with the stove-top method. If you don’t have a
microwave-safe bowl large enough to accommodate all of the onions, cook
in a smaller bowl in 2 batches.

If using ordinary soup bowls, sprinkle the toasted bread slices with
Gruyere and return them to the broiler until the cheese melts, then
float them on top of the soup.

Source: `Cooks
Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/770-beef-barley-soup-with-mushrooms-and-thyme>`__


Ingredients
-----------

Rich Beef Broth For Soup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  2 tablespoons vegetable oil
-  6 pounds beef shank meat cut from bone in large chunks, or 4 pounds
   chuck and 2 pounds of small marrow bones
-  1 large onion, halved
-  1/2 cup dry red wine
-  1/2 teaspoon table salt


Soup
^^^^

-  2 tablespoons vegetable oil
-  1 medium onion, cut into medium dice
-  2 medium carrots, cut into medium dice
-  12 ounces domestic mushrooms or wild mushrooms, stems removed, wiped
   clean, and sliced thin
-  1/2 teaspoon dried thyme or 1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme
-  1/2 cup canned tomatoes, cut into medium dice
-  1/2 cup pearl barley
-  1/4 cup minced fresh flat leaf parsley leaves
-  Salt and ground black pepper

Directions
----------

Broth
^^^^^

1. Heat 1 tablepoon oil in a large soup kettle or Dutch oven over
   medium-high heat; brown meat, bones, and onion halves on all sides in
   batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan, and adding the
   additional teaspoon and a half of oil to the pan if necessary. Remove
   and set aside. Add red wine to the empty kettle; cook until reduced
   to a syrup, 1 to 2 minutes. Return browned bones, meat, and onion to
   kettle. Reduce heat to low, then cover and sweat meat and onions
   until they have released about 3/4 cup dark, very intensely flavored
   liquid, about 20 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high, add 2 quarts
   water and salt; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to very low, partially
   cover, and barely simmer until meat is tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
2. Strain broth, discard bones and onions, and set meat aside, reserving
   half of the meat for another use. (At this point broth and meat can
   be cooled to room temperature and covered and refrigerated up to 5
   days.) Let broth stand until fat rises to the top; skim and discard
   fat. When the unreserved meat is cool enough to handle, shred into
   bite-size pieces. Reserve 2 cups shredded meat for soup.


Soup
^^^^

1. Heat oil over medium-high heat in a soup kettle or Dutch oven. Add
   onion and carrots; saute until almost soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add
   mushrooms; saute until softened and liquid almost evaporates, 4 to 5
   minutes longer. Add thyme and tomatoes, then beef broth, meat, and
   barley; bring to simmer. Reduce heat to low; simmer until barley is
   just tender, 45 to 50 minutes. Stir in parsley, adjust seasonings,
   including salt and pepper to taste, and serve.

-  1 1/2 teaspoons dry mustard powder

Cauliflower Soup
================

+-----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------+
| Prep Time: 15 minutes | Cooking Time: 1 1/2 hours | Yield: 4-6 servings |
+-----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------+

Source: `Cooks
Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/7491-cauliflower-soup>`__


Ingredients
-----------

-  1 head cauliflower (2 pounds)
-  8 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces
-  1 leek, white and light green parts only, halved lengthwise, sliced
   thin, and washed thoroughly
-  1 small onion, halved and sliced thin
-  Salt and pepper
-  4 1/2 - 5 cups water
-  1/2 teaspoon sherry vinegar (or white wine vinegar)
-  3 tablespoons minced fresh chives

Directions
----------

1. Pull off outer leaves of cauliflower and trim stem. Using paring
   knife, cut around core to remove; thinly slice core and reserve. Cut
   heaping 1 cup of 1/2-inch florets from head of cauliflower; set
   aside. Cut remaining cauliflower crosswise into 1/2-inch thick
   slices.
2. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add
   leek, onion, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt; cook, stirring frequently,
   until leek and onion are softened but not browned, about 7 minutes.
3. Increase heat to medium-high; add 4 1/2 cups water, sliced core, and
   half of sliced cauliflower; and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to
   medium-low and simmer gently for 15 minutes. Add remaining sliced
   cauliflower, return to simmer, and continue to cook until cauliflower
   is tender and crumbles easily, 15 to 20 minutes longer.
4. While soup simmers, melt remaining 5 tablespoons butter in 8-inch
   skillet over medium heat. Add reserved florets and cook, stirring
   frequently, until florets are golden brown and butter is browned and
   imparts nutty aroma, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and use
   slotted spoon to transfer florets to small bowl. Toss florets with
   vinegar and season with salt to taste. Pour browned butter in skillet
   into small bowl and reserve for garnishing.
5. Process soup in blender until smooth, about 45 seconds. Rinse out
   pan. Return pureed soup to pan and return to simmer over medium heat,
   adjusting consistency with remaining water as needed (soup should
   have thick, velvety texture but should be thin enough to settle with
   flat surface after being stirred) and seasoning with salt to taste.
   Serve, garnishing individual bowls with browned florets, drizzle of
   browned butter, and chives and seasoning with pepper to taste.

+---------------------------+---------------+


Ingredients
-----------

-  1 carcass from 12- to 14-pound turkey
-  10 cups water

Freezing stock in portions of different sizes makes it easy to defrost
it for different applications. Stock can be frozen for up to four
months. \* **Ice Cube Tray:** After the cubes have frozen, transfer them
to a zipper-lock bag. Use the 2-tablespoon portions for pan sauces or
stir-fry sauces. \* **Muffin Tin:** Once frozen, transfer the 1-cup
portions to a zipper-lock bag. Use them for rice, risotto, grains,
couscous, or casseroles or as a braising liquid. \* **Zipper-Lock Bag:**
Line a 4-cup measuring cup with a zipper-lock bag; pour in the cooled
stock. Lay the bag flat to freeze. Use for soups, stews, or gravy.
