Mulled Wine
===========

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 clementines
-  Peel of 1 lemon
-  Peel of 1 lime
-  2 tablespoons caster sugar
-  6 whole cloves
-  1 cinnamon stick
-  3 fresh bay leaves
-  1 whole nutmeg
-  1 whole vanilla pod, halved
-  2 star anise
-  2 bottles of Chianti, or other Italian red wine

Directions
----------

1. Peel large sections of peel from your clementines, lemon and lime
   using a speed peeler. Put the sugar in a large saucepan over a medium
   heat, add the pieces of peel and squeeze in the clementine juice. Add
   the cloves, cinnamon stick, bay leaves and about 10 to 12 gratings of
   nutmeg. Throw in your halved vanilla pod and stir in just enough red
   wine to cover the sugar. Let this simmer until the sugar has
   completely dissolved into the red wine and then bring to the boil.
   Keep on a rolling boil for about 4 to 5 minutes, or until you’ve got
   a beautiful thick syrup. The reason I’m doing this first is to create
   a wonderful flavour base by really getting the sugar and spices to
   infuse and blend well with the wine. It’s important to make a syrup
   base first because it needs to be quite hot, and if you do this with
   both bottles of wine in there you’ll burn off the alcohol.
2. When your syrup is ready turn the heat down to low and add your star
   anise and both bottles of wine. Gently heat the wine and after around
   5 minutes, when it’s warm and delicious, ladle it into glasses and
   serve.
