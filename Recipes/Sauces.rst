   1/2 cup)
-  1 small rib celery, chopped into rough 1/2-inch pieces (about 1/2
   cup)
-  1 small onion, chopped into rough 1/2-inch pieces (about 3/4 cup)
-  3 tablespoons unsalted butter
-  1/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
-  2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
-  2 cups low-sodium beef broth
-  1 bay leaf
-  1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
-  5 whole black peppercorns
-  Salt and ground black pepper


Directions
----------

1. In food processor, pulse carrot until broken into rough 1/4-inch
   pieces, about five 1-second pulses. Add celery and onion; pulse until
   all vegetables are broken into 1/8-inch pieces, about five 1-second
   pulses.

Simple Quick Gravy
==================

+-----------------+-------------------+---------------+
| Prep: 5 minutes | Total: 15 minutes | Yield: 2 cups |
+-----------------+-------------------+---------------+

Quick beef broth brown gravy that can be made in just 15 minutes with only
a few ingredients.

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 1/3 cups beef broth (reduced sodium)
- 2/3 cup chicken broth (reduced sodium)
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/4 teaspoon ground thyme
- 2-3 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1/4 cup cold water
- 2-3 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 tablespoons cold unsalted butter (optional)
- salt and pepper to taste

Directions
----------

1. In a medium sauce pan bring broth to boil over medium-high heat.
   Stir in onion powder, garlic powder, thyme, and Worcestershire sauce.
2. In a small bowl whisk together cold water and corn starch until
   dissolved. Whisk into boiling beef broth and reduce heat to medium-lowR
   and simmer until gravy is thickened to your liking.
3. Season with salt and pepper. Taste, add more salt and pepper if needed,
   and taste again to make sure it's just right.
4. Remove from heat and optionally whisk in butter.  Serve immediately or
   cool and refrigerate for up to 5 days.

Variations
----------

* ROUX – If you want to use a roux, start out with 2 tablespoons unsalted
  butter in the saucepan, and heat until melted.  Whisk in 2 Tbsp all
  purpose flour and cook about 1 minute. Slowly add in broths, whisking
  the mixture as you pour, until mixture is smooth.  Proceed with recipe as
  written, omitting the water and cornstarch.
* DRIPPINGS – Substitute them for some of the broth.
* BROTH – for a beefier flavor, try using all beef broth (2 cups).  For a
  lighter flavor, and color, increase the amount of chicken broth and
  reduce the amount of beef.  Just keep it at 2 cups total.
* ONION – Finely mince some onion and saute it in the saucepan with a drizzle
  of oil over MED heat for about 5 minutes.  Then add broth and continue with
  the recipe as written.
* FRESH HERBS – try adding a sprig or two of fresh thyme or rosemary to the
  saucepan with the broth.  It adds a beautiful herby flavor!  Just remember
  to remove the woody stems before serving.
* MUSHROOMS – Saute sliced mushrooms in the saucepan with a drizzle of oil
  over MED heat for about 5 minutes.  Then add broth and continue with the
  recipe as written.

Turkey Gravy
============


Ingredients
-----------

-  1 tablespoon vegetable oil
-  Reserved turkey giblets and neck
-  1 onion, unpeeled and chopped
-  4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
-  2 cups water
-  2 sprigs fresh thyme
-  8 parsley stems
-  3 tablespoons unsalted butter
-  1/4 cup all-purpose flour
-  1 cup dry white wine


Directions
----------

1.  Make the Broth: Heat oil in large saucepan over medium-high heat.
    Brown turkey giblets and neck for 5 minutes. Cook onion for 3
    minutes. Cover and cook over low heat for 20 minutes.
2.  Add chicken broth and water, scrape pan bottom, and bring to boil.
    Add herbs and simmer, skimming foam from surface, for 30 minutes.
3.  Pour broth through fine-mesh strainer. Reserve and dice heart and
    gizzard. Refrigerate broth and diced giblets until ready to use.
4.  Make the Roux and Thicken the Broth: Melt butter in large saucepan
    over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour. Cook, stirring constantly,
    until nutty brown and fragrant, 10 to 15 minutes. Bring reserved
    turkey broth to simmer.
5.  Gradually add hot turkey broth to roux. Vigorous and constant
    whisking at this point is key to avoiding lumps. Reserve 1 cup of
    broth for deglazing roasting pan (see #9).

    with spoon, until thickened, about 30 minutes. Set aside, covered,
    until turkey is done.
7.  Deglaze the Pan and Add the Drippings To the Gravy: Pour drippings
    through mesh strainer set over measuring cup. Let liquid settle
    until fat rises to top. Return vegetables in strainer to roasting
    pan.
8.  Tilt measuring cup and use wide, shallow soup spoon to skim fat off
    surface. Reserve defatted drippings. Return gravy in saucepan to
    simmer.
9.  Place roasting pan over two burners at medium-high heat. Add wine
    and reserved 1 cup broth and scrape up browned bits in pan. Boil
    until liquid reduces by half, 5 minutes.

    all liquid. Add defatted drippings to taste. Stir in giblets and
    serve.

Sauce Base (Demi-glace)
=======================

Source: `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/1431-sauce-base-for-steak-diane-demi-glace>`__

This recipe yields a sauce base that is an excellent facsimile of a demi-glace,
a very labor-intensive and time-consuming classic French sauce base. Because
the sauce base is very concentrated, make sure to use low-sodium chicken and
beef broths; otherwise, the base may be unpalatably salty.

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 4 teaspoons tomato paste
- 2 small onions, chopped medium (about 1 1/3 cups)
- 1 medium carrot, chopped medium (about 1/2 cup)
- 4 medium cloves garlic, peeled
- 1/4 cup water
- 4 teaspoons unbleached all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 cups dry red wine
- 3 1/2 cups low-sodium beef broth
- 1 3/4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 2 teaspoons black peppercorns
- 8 sprigs fresh thyme
- 2 bay leaves

Directions
----------

1. Heat oil and tomato paste in Dutch oven over medium-high heat; cook,
   stirring constantly, until paste begins to brown, about 3 minutes. Add
   onions, carrot, and garlic; cook, stirring frequently, until mixture is
   reddish brown, about 2 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons water and continue to
   cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is well browned, about 3 minutes,
   adding remaining water when needed to prevent scorching. Add flour and
   cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute. Add wine and, using a heatproof
   rubber spatula, scrape up browned bits on bottom and sides of pot; bring
   to boil, stirring occasionally (mixture will thicken slightly). Add beef
   and chicken broths, peppercorns, thyme, and bay; bring to boil and cook,
   uncovered, occasionally scraping bottom and sides of pot with spatula,
   until reduced to 2 1/2 cups, 35 to 40 minutes.
2. Strain mixture through fine-mesh strainer, pressing on solids to extract
   as much liquid as possible; you should have about 1 1/4 cups.

Notes
-----

* The sauce base can be made ahead and refrigerated for up to three days.
* To Freeze For Another Use:After straining the sauce base, portion the
  sauce into plastic ice cube trays and freeze. Use these cubes to create a
  quick sauce for grilled, broiled, or pan-seared steaks or chops.
* Variations:To make a very potent sauce for two people, melt two demi-glace
  cubes in a small skillet and finish by whisking in 1/2 tablespoon unsalted
  butter. For a less rich sauce that can serve four, melt two demi-glace
  cubes with 2 tablespoons water and then finish with 1/2 tablespoon butter.
  Either way, the sauce base already has highly concentrated flavors, so you
  will probably not need to season this quick sauce with salt and pepper.

Sauce Base
==========

Source: `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/6965-sauce-base>`__

In our Sauce Base recipe for Pan-Seared Steaks, roughly chopping the
aromatics increased their surface area, which offered more
opportunity for flavorful browning when we sauteed them. Mushrooms
ramped up the savory flavor, and browning ground beef with tomato
paste gave our demi-glace meatiness. And to mimic the glossiness that
real demi-glace gets from collagen-rich bones, we used powdered
gelatin.


Ingredients
-----------

-  1 small onion, peeled and cut into rough 1/2-inch pieces
-  1 small carrot, peeled and cut into rough 1/2-inch pieces
-  8 ounces cremini mushrooms, stems trimmed and caps wipes clean and
   halved
-  2 medium garlic cloves, peeled
-  1 tablespoon vegetable oil
-  8 ounces 85 percent lean ground beef
-  1 tablespoon tomato paste
-  2 cups dry red wine
-  4 cups low-sodium beef broth (see note)
-  4 sprigs fresh thyme
-  2 bay leaves
-  2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns
-  2 packages (5 teaspoons) unflavored powdered gelatin


Directions
----------

1. Process onion, carrot, mushrooms, and garlic in food processor into
   1/8-inch pieces, 10 to 12 one-second pulses, scraping down sides of
   bowl as needed.
2. Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering; add
   beef and tomato paste and cook, stirring frequently, until beef is
   well browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Add vegetable mixture and cook,
   stirring occasionally, until any exuded moisture has evaporated,
   about 8 minutes. Add wine and bring to simmer, scraping bottom of pan
   with wooden spoon to loosen browned bits. Add beef broth, thyme, bay
   leaves, and peppercorns; bring to boil. Reduce heat and gently boil,
   occasionally scraping bottom and sides of pot and skimming fat from
   surface, until reduced to 2 cups, 20 to 25 minutes.
3. Strain mixture through fine-mesh strainer set over small saucepan,
   pressing on solids with rubber spatula to extract as much liquid as
   possible (you should have about 1 cup stock). Sprinkle gelatin over
   stock and stir to dissolve. Place saucepan over medium-high heat and
   bring stock to boil. Gently boil, stirring occasionally, until
   reduced to 1/2 cup, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and cover to
   keep warm.


Make Ahead
----------

Sauce Base can be refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to one
month.

-  1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
-  1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
-  2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces
-  1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves
-  Salt and ground black pepper


Directions
----------

Pour off any fat from skillet in which steaks were cooked. Heat oil over
medium-high heat until just smoking. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring
occasionally, until beginning to brown and liquid has evaporated, about
5 minutes. Add shallot and cook, stirring frequently, until beginning to
soften, about 1 minute. Increase heat to high; add red wine and broth,
scraping bottom of skillet with wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits.
Simmer rapidly until liquid and mushrooms are reduced to 1 cup, about 6
minutes. Add vinegar, mustard, and any juices from resting steaks; cook
until thickened, about 1 minute. Off heat, whisk in butter and thyme;
season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon sauce over steaks and serve
immediately.

Basil Pesto
===========

+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| Total: 30 minutes | Yield: Makes 3/4 cup, enough for 1 pound of pasta |
+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------+

Source: `www.cooksillustrated.com <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/1567-basil-pesto?incode=MCSCD00L0>`__

Ingredients
-----------

- 1/4 cup pine nut, toasted (or substitute almonds or walnuts)
- 3 garlic clove, unpeeled
- 2 cups packed fresh basil leafNone
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley leaves(optional)
- 1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oilNone
- 1/2 teaspoon saltNone
- 1/4 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese or Pecorino Romano

Directions
----------

1. Toast the nuts in a small, heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring
   frequently, until just golden and fragrant, about 5 minutes; set aside.
   Add the garlic to the empty skillet and toast over medium heat, shaking
   the pan occasionally, until fragrant and the color of the cloves deepens
   slightly, about 7 minutes. Let the garlic cool slightly, then peel, and
   chop.
2. Place the basil and parsley (if using) in a heavy-duty 1-gallon zipper-
   lock plastic bag. Pound the bag with the flat side of a meat pounder or
   rolling pin until all the leaves are bruised.
3. Process the nuts, garlic, herbs, oil, and 1⁄2 teaspoon salt in a food
   processor until smooth, stopping as necessary to scrape down the sides
   of the bowl, about 1 minute. Stir in the Parmesan and season with salt
   and pepper to taste.

Notes
-----

Pounding the basil releases its flavorful oils into the pesto more readily.
Basil usually darkens in homemade pesto, but you can boost the green color
a little by adding the optional parsley. For sharper flavor, substitute one
tablespoon finely grated pecorino Romano cheese for one tablespoon of the
Parmesan. The pesto can be kept in an airtight container, covered with a
thin layer of oil (1 to 2 tablespoons), and refrigerated for up to four
days or frozen for up to one month.

Joe Beef Mustard
================

+-----------------+-----------------+--------------+
| Prep: 5 minutes | Time: 5 minutes | Yield: 1 cup |
+-----------------+-----------------+--------------+

Source: The Art of Living According to Joe Beef

Ingredients
-----------

- 1/2 cup (90 g) mustard seeds
- 5 tablespoons (75 ml) water
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup
- Scant 2 tablespoons neutral oil
- 1 1/4 cups (300 ml) white wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon ground turmeric
- Pinch of cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon salt

Directions
----------

1. In a powerful food processor, combine the mustard seeds, water,
   maple syrup, oil, one-third of the vinegar, the turmeric, the cayenne,
   and the salt and process on high speed. (If it is not powerful, you
   will end up with more whole seeds, which is okay but not ideal.) Once
   you start, the seeds will bounce around like money in a money cage.
2. When the seeds stop bouncing around, slowly add the rest of the
   vinegar. When the blade stops spinning well and the mustard is thick,
   it’s ready. Transfer to a tightly capped jar and store in the fridge
   for up to a month.

Homemade Dijon Mustard
======================

Source: `Food Wishes Blog <https://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2015/01/hello-its-chef-dijon-from-foodwishescom.html>`__


Ingredients
-----------

- 3/4 cup white wine
- 1/3 cup white wine vinegar (original recipe calls for 1/4 cup)
- 1/2 cup water, plus more as needed
- 1/2 yellow onion, chopped
- 1 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/2 cup yellow mustard seeds
- 2 tablespoons mustard
- 1/2 tablespoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions
----------

1. Combine the white wine, vinegar, water, onion, and garlic in a saucepan.
   Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove
   from heat and allow to cool to room temperature. Strain the mixture
   through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing on the onions and garlic to extract
   all the juices. Discard the onion and garlic.
2. Combine the flavored vinegar liquid, mustard seed, dry mustard, garlic
   powder and salt in a quart-size mason jar. Cover and let stand at room
   temperature for 24 to 48 hours.
3. Pour the mixture into a blender and puree until it a creamy consistency.
   Pour into a saucepan, bring to a boil and then reduce the heat and
   simmer until the mixture is thickened but still pourable, about
   10 minutes.
4. If canning, have your water bath canner ready. Pour the hot mustard into
   clean pint-size or half-pint jars, leaving 1/2" headspace. Use a clean
   toothpick or spatula to release any trapped air in the mustard. Process
   for 10 minutes, adjusting for altitude.
5. Alternatively, allow the jars to cool and store in the refrigerator for
   up to three months.
