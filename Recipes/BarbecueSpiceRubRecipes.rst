Mr. Brown Smoke and Spice
=========================

When it comes to brisket and pork, because they have to cook so long,
I’ve never had sugar make it sweet. The more sugar the greater the bark,
but I would not describe it as sweet the bark as sweet. But you can
always add more sugar, and you may pick up a sweet taste.

Ingredients
-----------

-  1/4 cup Black Pepper, fresh cracked
-  1/4 cup Paprika
-  1/4 cup Turbinado Sugar or Brown Sugar
-  2 tablespoon kosher salt
-  2 teaspoons mustard, dry
-  1 teaspoon cayenne pepper

*(Makes enough for one 6 - 8 lb. Boston Butt)*

Notes
-----

Cut back on the black pepper and cayenne pepper for less heat.
