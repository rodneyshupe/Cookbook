Ingredients
-----------

-  2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
-  2 tablespoon cornmeal
-  1 teaspoon table salt
-  2 teaspoon baking soda
-  2 egg, separated
-  1 3/4 cup buttermilk
-  4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

*If you’re out of buttermilk, substitute a little less milk (1 1/2 scant
cup) and add 4 teaspoons cream of tartar to the dry ingredients.*

*If using kosher salt, use 1 1/4 teaspoons*

Directions
----------

1. Heat waffle iron. Whisk dry ingredients together in a medium bowl.
   Whisk yolk with milk and butter.
2. Beat egg white until it just holds a 2-inch peak.
3. Add liquid ingredients to dry ingredients in a thin steady stream
   while gently mixing with a rubber spatula; be careful not to add
   liquid faster than you can incorporate it. Toward end of mixing, use
   a folding motion to incorporate ingredients; gently fold egg white
   into batter.
4. Spread appropriate amount of batter onto waffle iron. Following
   manufacturer’s instructions, cook waffle until golden brown, 2 to 5
   minutes. Serve immediately. (You can keep waffles warm on a wire rack
   in a 200°F oven for up to 5 minutes.)
