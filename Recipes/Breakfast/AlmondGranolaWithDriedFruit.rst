Ingredients
-----------

-  1/3 cup maple syrup
-  1/3 cup packed (2 1/3 ounces) light brown sugar
-  4 teaspoons vanilla extract
-  1/2 teaspoon salt
-  1/2 cup vegetable oil
-  5 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
-  2 cups (10 ounces) raw almonds, chopped coarse
-  2 cups raisins or other dried fruit, chopped

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 325Â°F.
   Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Whisk maple syrup, brown sugar, vanilla, and salt in large bowl.
   Whisk in oil. Fold in oats and almonds until thoroughly coated.
3. Transfer oat mixture to prepared baking sheet and spread across sheet
   into thin, even layer (about 3/8 inch thick). Using stiff metal
   spatula, compress oat mixture until very compact. Bake until lightly
   browned, 40 to 45 minutes, rotating pan once halfway through baking.
   Remove granola from oven and cool on wire rack to room temperature,
   about 1 hour. Break cooled granola into pieces of desired size. Stir
   in dried fruit.

*Granola can be stored in airtight container for up to 2 weeks.*
