+----------------------+--------------------------+---------------+

Source: Raichlen’s Indoor Grilling by Steven Raichlen

This is one of the simplest and best barbecue sauces you can make. This
sauce follows in the traditions of sauces created in the kitchens of
Kansas City for decades. It has a thick sweet, smoky flavor that goes
great with ribs.

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 cups ketchup
-  1/4 cup molasses
-  1/4 cup cider vinegar
-  1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
-  3 tablespoons brown sugar
-  2 tablespoons prepared mustard
-  1 tablespoon dry mustard
-  2 teaspoons liquid smoke
-  1 teaspoon garlic powder
-  1 teaspoon onion powder
-  1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper

Directions
----------

1. Place the all the ingredients in a heavy nonreactive saucepan and
   whisk to mix.
2. Slowly bring sauce to a boil over medium heat. Let the sauce simmer
   gently until thick and richly flavoured, about 10-20 minutes,
   whisking several times.
3. Taste for seasoning, adding more of any of the ingredients you may
   desire.
4. Transfer the hot sauce to glass jars. Tightly cover the jar and let
   the sauce cool to room temperature.
5. Once the jar is opened, refrigerate the sauce; it will keep for
   several months.

South Carolina Style Mustard Barbecue Sauce
===========================================

+----------------------+--------------------------+---------------+
| Prep Time: 5 minutes | Cooking Time: 30 minutes | Yield: 3 cups |
+----------------------+--------------------------+---------------+

In the central and southern regions of South Carolina, Mustard is king.
This golden barbecue sauce is the perfect compliment to smoked pork and
its popularity is growing as more and more people turn away from those
sticky sweet tomato sauces that line the shelves of grocery stores. This
sauce combines the mild heat of mustard with the tanginess of vinegar to
give you something incredible. This sauce works well with almost
anything, but is particularly excellent for pork.

Ingredients
-----------

-  1 1/2 cups prepared mustard
-  3/4 cups cider vinegar
-  1/2 cup brown sugar
-  3 tablespoons butter
-  3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
-  1 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice
-  1 1/2 teaspoon cyanne pepper

Directions
----------

1. Place the all the ingredients in a heavy nonreactive saucepan and
   whisk to mix. Simmer over a low heat for 30 minutes.

Memphis Style Barbecue Sauce
============================

Whether there is a true style to a sauce in a city that prefers their
barbecue “dry” is a debate for the ages. Through the rumblings I’m sure
will follow, what is fairly solid is as we move east from Kansas City,
barbecue sauce starts to transform from thick and sweet, to the thinner
and tangier kind. This “Memphis-style” takes the aspects of sweet
tomato-based sauces, but by dialing back the sugar and amping up the
vinegar, creates a sauce where seasonings and spice are more defined and
achieves a pleasing balance between the main defining aspects of a
barbecue sauce.

This thinner sauce bakes into tasty layers and caramelizes beautifully.
It creates a flavor-packed sheen when finished on ribs and is an
excellent consistency for dipping. Slop it on a pile of pulled pork.

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 tablespoons unsalted butter
-  1 small onion, finely chopped
-  2 cloves garlic, minced
-  2 cups tomato sauce
-  1/2 cup cider vinegar
-  1/3 cup rice vinegar
-  1/3 cup molasses
-  3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
-  2 tablespoons packed dark brown sugar
-  2 teaspoons yellow mustard
-  1 teaspoon Louisiana hot sauce
-  1 teaspoon Kosher salt
-  1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
-  1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions
----------

1. Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook
   until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant,
   about 30 seconds.
2. Add tomato sauce, cider vinegar, rice vinegar, molasses,
   Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, mustard, hot sauce, salt, black
   pepper, and cayenne and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce
   heat to low and simmer until slightly thickened, about 15-20 minutes,
   stirring occasionally.
3. Transfer sauce to the jar of a blender and blend until smooth. Let
   cool to room temperature, transfer to a jar and store in refrigerator
   for up to a month.

Makes 4 cups

Peri Peri Sauce
===============

This is a sauce with some history: Its primary ingredient, a particular
hot chili, comes from the New World via the Portuguese, who brought it
to their colonies of Mozambique and Angola. This fiery, fragrant sauce
is equally common in Portugal and Africa these days, and goes
wonderfully with grilled fish or shrimp. Try piri piri with fried foods,
too. This recipe makes about 1 cup.

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 tablespoons red hot chili paste or 10 red hot chiles, such as Thai
-  1/2 cup fresh lemon juice (4-5 lemons)
-  2 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro (optional)
-  1 tablespoon chopped flat leaf parsley (optional)
-  5 chopped garlic cloves
-  1/2 teaspoons salt
-  1/2 cup olive

Directions
----------

1. If you are using fresh red chiles – it is important that they be red,
   for the proper color of piri piri – chop them roughly. If you really
   want to make this authentic, find yourself the tiny “bird’s eye”
   chiles, which are appallingly hot. Any hot chile will do, though.
2. Throw everything into a food processor except the oil. Buzz on high
   until smooth.
3. Once the sauce begins to get smooth, drizzle in the oil slowly while
   the machine is running. Once it is all incorporated, put the sauce in
   a glass jar and let stand at room temperature for up to a day.
4. For longer storage, seal in a jar and keep in the fridge up to a
   month.

*How best to use piri piri? With seafood that is fried, grilled or
broiled. A little goes a long way.*
