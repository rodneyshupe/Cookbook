Ingredients
------------

- 1 1 1/2 lb. boneless rib-eye steak, room temperature
- Kosher salt
- 1 1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper, plus more
- 3 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 8 oz semifirm cheese (such as cheddar or Comté), cut into ¾" cubes
- 4 oz pickled sweet cherry peppers or peperoncini, cut into ¾" pieces
- Extra-virgin olive oil (for drizzling)
- Flaky sea salt

Directions
----------

1. Pat steak dry with paper towels and generously season all over with
   kosher salt and 1 1/2 tsp. black pepper (or more if you like). Let sit
   15 minutes.
2. Heat oil in a medium skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high.
   Cook steak, undisturbed, until a deep golden brown crust forms
   underneath, about 3 minutes. Turn over and repeat on second side until
   browned, about 3 minutes. If steak has a fat cap, stand it on its side
   with tongs and cook until browned, about 3 minutes (an instant-read
   thermometer inserted into the thickest part should register 120° for
   medium-rare). Transfer to a cutting board; let rest 15 minutes. Slice
   steak against the grain 1/8"–1/4" thick.
3. Working with 1 skewer at a time, thread skewer through a strip of steak
   near a short end. Slide a cube of cheese, then a piece of cherry pepper
   onto skewer. Thread opposite side of steak onto skewer to close. Push
   steak, cheese, and cherry pepper snugly against one another to form a
   compact bundle situated toward the tip of the skewer.
4. Arrange skewers on a large plate. Drizzle with oil and sprinkle with
   sea salt and black pepper.
