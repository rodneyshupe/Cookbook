Seared Mushrooms with egg Yolk
==============================

Ingredients
-----------

-  3 tablespoons olive oil plus more for sage
-  1/4 cup (loosely packed) fresh sage leaves
-  2 pounds (900g) mix of wild mushrooms (such as chanterelle, cremini,
   portobello, shiitake, enoki, oyster, hen of the woods, and porcini),
   cleaned, stems trimmed
-  2 tbsp Sherry
-  1/2 tbsp Sherry Vinegar
-  4 baguette slices, toasted (french or sourdough)
-  4 eggs

Directions
----------

1. Pour oil into a small skillet to a depth of 1/8â€œ. Heat over medium
   heat. Add sage and cook, turning often, until leaves just start to
   crisp, about 30 seconds (do not brown). Transfer sage to paper towels
   to drain. Strain oil through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl; set
   sage oil aside.
2. In a medium to large skillet heat 1 tbsp olive oil over medium heat.
   Add mushrooms and season with salt and pepper. Sear till they start
   to release their liquid. Add Sherry and reduce 30 - 60 seconds. Add
   Vinegar and deglaze the pan.
3. Transfer mushrooms to a large platter with toast add reserved sage
   leaves and drizzle with some sage oil. Season to taste with salt and
   pepper.
4. Pour water into a small pot to a depth of 2 inches; bring to a
   simmer. Separate eggs, reserving whites for another use and keeping
   whole yolks in shells. Working with 2 yolks at a time, gently slip
   yolks from shells into simmering water. Poach until outside is set
   but inside is still runny, about 30 seconds. Using a slotted spoon,
   place yolks over mushrooms, spacing apart. Serve immediately.
