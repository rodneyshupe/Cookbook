Crispy Salt and Pepper Shrimp
=============================

Ingredients
-----------

-  1 pound shell-on shrimp (31 to 40 per pound)
-  2 tablespoons Chinese rice wine or dry sherry
-  Kosher salt
-  2 1/2 teaspoons black peppercorns
-  2 teaspoons Sichuan peppercorns
-  2 teaspoons sugar
-  1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
-  4 cups vegetable oil
-  5 tablespoons cornstarch
-  2 jalapeno chiles, stemmed, seeded, and sliced into 1/8-inch-thick
   rings
-  3 garlic cloves, minced
-  1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
-  2 scallions, sliced thin on bias
-  1/4 head iceberg lettuce, shredded (1 1/2 cups)

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 225°F.
   Toss shrimp, rice wine, and 1 teaspoon salt together in large bowl
   and set aside for 10 to 15 minutes.
2. Grind black peppercorns and Sichuan peppercorns in spice grinder or
   mortar and pestle until coarsely ground. Transfer peppercorns to
   small bowl and stir in sugar and cayenne.
3. Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium heat until oil registers
   385°F. While oil is heating, drain shrimp and pat dry with paper
   towels. Transfer shrimp to bowl, add 3 tablespoons cornstarch and 1
   tablespoon peppercorn mixture, and toss until well combined.
4. Carefully add half of shrimp to oil and fry, stirring occasionally to
   keep shrimp from sticking together, until light brown, 2 to 3
   minutes. Using wire skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer shrimp to
   paper towel-lined plate. Once paper towels absorb any excess oil,
   transfer shrimp to wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and place in
   oven. Return oil to 385°F and repeat in 2 more batches, tossing each
   batch thoroughly with coating mixture before frying.
5. Toss jalapeno rings and remaining 2 tablespoons cornstarch in medium
   bowl. Shaking off excess cornstarch, carefully add jalapeño rings to
   oil and fry until crispy, 1 to 2 minutes. Using wire skimmer or
   slotted spoon, transfer jalapeno rings to paper towel-lined plate.
   After frying, reserve 2 tablespoons frying oil.
6. Heat reserved oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until
   shimmering. Add garlic, ginger, and remaining peppercorn mixture and
   cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture is fragrant and just
   beginning to brown, about 45 seconds. Add shrimp, scallions, and 1/2
   teaspoon salt and toss to coat. Line platter with lettuce. Transfer
   shrimp to platter, sprinkle with jalapeno rings, and serve
   immediately.
