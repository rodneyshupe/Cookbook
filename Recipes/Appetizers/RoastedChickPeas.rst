Roasted Chick Peas
==================

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 1/2 cups cooked chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling
- Sea salt
- Paprika, curry powder, or other spices (optional)

Directions
----------

1. Preheat the oven to 425Â°F and line a large baking sheet with parchment
   paper.
2. Spread the chickpeas on a kitchen towel and pat them dry. Remove any
   loose skins.
3. Transfer the dried chickpeas to the baking sheet and toss them with a
   drizzle of olive oil and generous pinches of salt.
4. Roast the chickpeas for 20 to 30 minutes, or until golden brown and
   crisp. Ovens can vary, if your chickpeas are not crispy enough, keep
   going until they are!
5. Remove from the oven and, while the chickpeas are still warm, toss
   with pinches of your favorite spices, if using.
6. Store roasted chickpeas in a loosely-covered container at room
   temperature. They are best used within two days.
