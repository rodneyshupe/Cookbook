Ingredients
------------

- 3 tablespoons raw pistachios
- 4 oz goat cheese
- 3 oz thinly sliced Calabrese or other spicy salami, finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
- 24 large dates (about 6 oz.), preferably Medjool, pitted
- Honey (for drizzling)


Directions
----------

1. Toast pistachios in a dry small skillet over medium heat, tossing
   occasionally, until golden brown, 5â€“8 minutes. Let cool slightly, then
   finely chop.
2. Mix goat cheese, salami, and lemon zest in a medium bowl.
3. Slice dates in half lengthwise, taking care not to cut all the way
   through, and open like a book. Stuff each date with a small scoop of
   goat cheese mixture.
4. Arrange dates, filling side up, on a large plate or platter. Drizzle
   honey over and top with pistachios.
