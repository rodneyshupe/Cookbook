Scallion Pancakes
=================

Ingredients
-----------

-  1 1/2 cups (7 1/2 ounces) plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
-  1/4 cup boiling water
-  7 tablespoons vegetable oil
-  1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
-  1 teaspoon kosher salt
-  4 medium scallions, sliced thin
-  `Dipping Sauce <#asian-dipping-sauce>`__

Directions
----------

1. Using wooden spoon, mix 1 1/2 cups flour and boiling water in bowl to
   form rough dough. When cool enough to handle, transfer dough to
   lightly floured counter and knead until tacky (but not sticky) ball
   forms, about 4 minutes (dough will not be perfectly smooth). Cover
   loosely with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes.
2. While dough is resting, stir together 1 tablespoon vegetable oil,
   sesame oil, and remaining 1 tablespoon flour. Set aside.
3. Place 10-inch cast-iron skillet over low heat to preheat. Divide
   dough in half. Cover 1 half of dough with plastic wrap and set aside.
   Roll remaining dough into 12-inch round on lightly floured counter.
   Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil-flour mixture and use pastry brush to
   spread evenly over entire surface. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt
   and half of scallions. Roll dough into cylinder. Coil cylinder into
   spiral, tuck end underneath, and flatten spiral with your palm. Cover
   with plastic and repeat with remaining dough, oil-flour mixture,
   salt, and scallions.
4. Roll first spiral into 9-inch round. Cut 1/2-inch slit in center of
   pancake. Cover with plastic. Roll and cut slit in second pancake.
   Place 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in skillet and increase heat to
   medium-low. Place 1 pancake in skillet (oil should sizzle). Cover and
   cook, shaking skillet occasionally, until pancake is slightly puffy
   and golden brown on underside, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. (If underside is
   not browned after 1 minute, turn heat up slightly. If it is browning
   too quickly, turn heat down slightly.) Drizzle 1 tablespoon vegetable
   oil over pancake. Use pastry brush to distribute over entire surface.
   Carefully flip pancake. Cover and cook, shaking skillet occasionally,
   until second side is golden brown, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Uncover
   skillet and continue to cook until bottom is deep golden brown and
   crispy, 30 to 60 seconds longer. Flip and cook until deep golden
   brown and crispy, 30 to 60 seconds. Transfer to wire rack. Repeat
   with remaining 3 tablespoons vegetable oil and remaining pancake. Cut
   each pancake into 8 wedges and serve, passing
   `dipping sauce <#asian-dipping-sauce>`__ separately.

Make Ahead
