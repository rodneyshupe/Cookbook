======================================

Ingredients
------------

- 1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 8 ounces extra-sharp Cheddar cheese, grated (about 2 cups)
- 1/4 cup mayonnaise
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh chives, divided (from a 1/2-ounce package)
- 1/2 cup raw pecan halves
- 1 1/2 teaspoons pure maple syrup
- 1/2 teaspoon olive oil
- 1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
- Crackers, for serving

Directions
----------

1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Line a small rimmed baking sheet with parchment
   paper; set aside.
2. Stir together cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, mayonnaise, Worcestershire,
   cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and 1/4 cup of the chives in a large bowl
   until thoroughly blended. Spoon mixture onto a work surface covered with
   plastic wrap; gather plastic around cheese, using your hands shape into
   a ball. Chill in plastic wrap until firm, about 2 hours.

   salt in a small bowl until evenly coated; spread in an even layer on
   prepared baking sheet.
2. Bake until browned, about 9-12 minutes, stirring every 3 minutes. Place
   baking sheet on a wire rack, and cool completely, about 30 minutes.
   Finely chop pecans.
