Coquilles St-Jacques
====================

Although coquilles St-Jacques simply means “scallops” in French, the
term is synonymous with the old French dish of scallops poached in white
wine, placed atop a puree of mushrooms in a scallop shell, covered with
a sauce made of the scallop poaching liquid, and gratineed under a
broiler.

Yield:  4 Servings

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 tbsp unsalted butter
-  1/2 cup diced shallots
-  8 oz button mushrooms, sliced
-  salt and pepper to taste
-  1 cup white wine (sauvignon blanc works well and is a good pairing)
-  1 pound sea scallops (about 12 scallops or 3 per person)
-  1/2 cup heavy cream
-  1 egg yolk
-  cayenne to taste
-  2 tsp minced tarragon
-  1 tsp lemon zest
-  1/4 cup grated Gruyere cheese

Directions
----------

1. Heat 2 tablespoons butter in small skillet over medium heat until
   foaming; add shallots and cook, stirring frequently, until
   translucent and a little bit golden. Add mushrooms and season with
   salt and pepper. Turn heat up to med-high and saute until they have
   released their liquid and are golden brown. Add Wine and bring to a
   simmer. Add Scallops to mixture and cook for 2 minutes per side.
   Remove Scallops and set aside.
2. Pour remaining mixture through a strainer to separate the liquids
   from the solids. And then return the liquid back to the pan along
   with any juices accumulated from the scallops. Bring mixture to a
   simmer over med-high heat. Add heavy cream and reduce by about half
   stirring frequently.
3. Once the sauce has reduced remove from heat and let cool for 1 minute
   exactly. Add egg yolk and whisk quickly(it is important that you
   whisk and shake the pan to do this quickly as you are not trying to
   cook the egg here.) Add the tarragon and lemon zest and a pinch of
   cayenne.
4. Divide out mushroom mixture between serving dishes (If you can get
   then Sea Scallop Shells work great. If not you can use a shallow
   gratin dish). Add an even amount of scallops to each dish. Spoon
   sauce evenly over the scallops. Top with Gruyere.
5. Broil on high, about 8-10 inches under the flame, until the scallops
   are hot, and the cheese is browned and bubbling. The edges will
   brulee or burn. This is not a problem, and actually how it’s supposed
   to look.

Make-a-head
-----------

You can make these ahead, and refrigerate until needed. To bring back to
temperature before you broil them, preheat oven to 350°F. and bake for
about 12-15 minutes , or until the centers are just warm. Switch oven to
broil, and broil on high as described.
