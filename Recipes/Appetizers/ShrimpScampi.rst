Ingredients
-----------

-  3 tablespoons salt
-  2 tablespoons sugar
-  1 1/2 pounds shell-on jumbo shrimp (16 to 20 per pound), peeled,
   deveined, and tails removed, shells reserved
-  2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
-  1 cup dry white wine
-  4 sprigs fresh thyme
-  3 tablespoons lemon juice, plus lemon wedges for serving
-  1 teaspoon cornstarch
-  8 garlic cloves, sliced thin
-  1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
-  1/4 teaspoon pepper
-  4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
-  1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat leaf parsley

Directions
----------

1. Dissolve salt and sugar in 1 quart cold water in large container.
   Submerge shrimp in brine, cover, and refrigerate for 15 minutes.
   Remove shrimp from brine and pat dry with paper towels.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch skillet over high heat until
   shimmering. Add shrimp shells and cook, stirring frequently, until
   they begin to turn spotty brown and skillet starts to brown, 2 to 4
   minutes. Remove skillet from heat and carefully add wine and thyme
   sprigs. When bubbling subsides, return skillet to medium heat and
   simmer gently, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Strain mixture
   through colander set over large bowl. Discard shells and reserve
   liquid (you should have about 2/3 cup). Wipe out skillet with paper
   towels.
3. Combine lemon juice and cornstarch in small bowl. Heat remaining 1
   tablespoon oil, garlic, pepper flakes, and pepper in now-empty
   skillet over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until garlic is
   fragrant and just beginning to brown at edges, 3 to 5 minutes. Add
   reserved wine mixture, increase heat to high, and bring to simmer.
   Reduce heat to medium, add shrimp, cover, and cook, stirring
   occasionally, until shrimp are just opaque, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove
   skillet from heat and, using slotted spoon, transfer shrimp to bowl.
4. Return skillet to medium heat, add lemon juice-cornstarch mixture,
   and cook until slightly thickened, 1 minute. Remove from heat and
   whisk in butter and parsley until combined. Return shrimp and any
   accumulated juices to skillet and toss to combine. Serve, passing
   lemon wedges separately.
