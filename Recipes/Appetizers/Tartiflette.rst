Ingredients
------------

- 4–5 medium yellow flesh potatoes, peeled or unpeeled
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 8 oz slab bacon or thick-cut bacon, diced
- 2 teaspoons butter
- 2 shallots, thinly sliced
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 10–12 oz Reblochon cheese, sliced (can substitute Fontina, Taleggio, or Camembert)
- 1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg, divided
- 1/3 cup whipping (35%) cream

Directions
----------

1. Preheat your oven to 400°F and set a large pot of cold water on the stove.
2. Add the potatoes to the pot, season the water with salt, and cover with a 
   lid. Bring the potatoes to a boil over high heat and cook until tender,
   15 to 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes and allow them to cool slightly
   before slicing about 1/4-inch thick.
3. Meanwhile, place an 8-inch cast iron skillet or ovenproof frying pan on 
   the stove and add the bacon. Turn the heat on to medium and cook until the
   bacon starts to sizzle. Add the butter and shallots and season with salt
   and pepper. Cook the bacon and shallots until the shallots are golden
   brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic, cook for 1 minute just to soften,
   then carefully deglaze the pan with the wine. Allow the wine to bubble
   away until almost all of the liquid has evaporated, 4 to 5 minutes.
4. Using a slotted spoon, remove the bacon and shallots from the pan and set 
   aside. Layer in half of the potatoes followed by half of the bacon and
   shallot mixture. Lay half of the cheese on top, sprinkle on half of the
   nutmeg, and repeat the layers to use up the remaining ingredients.
   Carefully pour the cream over the whole lot and transfer the pan to the
   oven. Bake the tartiflette until everything is bubbling and golden brown,
   10 to 15 minutes. Allow the tartiflette to cool slightly for 5 to 10
   minutes before servings
