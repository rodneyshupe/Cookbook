=============

+-----------------------+--------------------------+---------------------+
| Prep Time: 10 minutes | Cooking Time: 30 minutes | Yield: 6-8 servings |
+-----------------------+--------------------------+---------------------+

Ingredients
-----------

-  3 tablespoons salt
-  2 tablespoons sugar
-  1 1/2 pounds shell-on jumbo shrimp (16 to 20 per pound), peeled,
   deveined, and tails removed, shells reserved
-  2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
-  1 cup dry white wine
-  4 sprigs fresh thyme
-  3 tablespoons lemon juice, plus lemon wedges for serving
-  1 teaspoon cornstarch
-  8 garlic cloves, sliced thin
-  1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
-  1/4 teaspoon pepper
-  4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
-  1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat leaf parsley

Directions
----------

1. Dissolve salt and sugar in 1 quart cold water in large container.
   Submerge shrimp in brine, cover, and refrigerate for 15 minutes.
   Remove shrimp from brine and pat dry with paper towels.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch skillet over high heat until
   shimmering. Add shrimp shells and cook, stirring frequently, until
   they begin to turn spotty brown and skillet starts to brown, 2 to 4
   minutes. Remove skillet from heat and carefully add wine and thyme
   sprigs. When bubbling subsides, return skillet to medium heat and

   through colander set over large bowl. Discard shells and reserve
   liquid (you should have about 2/3 cup). Wipe out skillet with paper
   towels.

   reserved wine mixture, increase heat to high, and bring to simmer.
   Reduce heat to medium, add shrimp, cover, and cook, stirring
   occasionally, until shrimp are just opaque, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove
   skillet from heat and, using slotted spoon, transfer shrimp to bowl.
4. Return skillet to medium heat, add lemon juice-cornstarch mixture,
   and cook until slightly thickened, 1 minute. Remove from heat and
   whisk in butter and parsley until combined. Return shrimp and any

Crispy Salt and Pepper Shrimp
=============================

Ingredients
-----------

-  1 pound shell-on shrimp (31 to 40 per pound)
-  2 tablespoons Chinese rice wine or dry sherry
-  Kosher salt
-  2 1/2 teaspoons black peppercorns
-  2 teaspoons Sichuan peppercorns
-  2 teaspoons sugar
-  1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
-  4 cups vegetable oil
-  5 tablespoons cornstarch
-  2 jalapeno chiles, stemmed, seeded, and sliced into 1/8-inch-thick
   rings
-  3 garlic cloves, minced
-  1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
-  2 scallions, sliced thin on bias
-  1/4 head iceberg lettuce, shredded (1 1/2 cups)

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 225°F.
   Toss shrimp, rice wine, and 1 teaspoon salt together in large bowl
   and set aside for 10 to 15 minutes.
2. Grind black peppercorns and Sichuan peppercorns in spice grinder or
   mortar and pestle until coarsely ground. Transfer peppercorns to
   small bowl and stir in sugar and cayenne.
3. Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium heat until oil registers

   towels. Transfer shrimp to bowl, add 3 tablespoons cornstarch and 1
   tablespoon peppercorn mixture, and toss until well combined.
4. Carefully add half of shrimp to oil and fry, stirring occasionally to
   keep shrimp from sticking together, until light brown, 2 to 3
   minutes. Using wire skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer shrimp to
   paper towel-lined plate. Once paper towels absorb any excess oil,
   transfer shrimp to wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and place in
   oven. Return oil to 385°F and repeat in 2 more batches, tossing each
   batch thoroughly with coating mixture before frying.
5. Toss jalapeno rings and remaining 2 tablespoons cornstarch in medium
   bowl. Shaking off excess cornstarch, carefully add jalapeño rings to
   oil and fry until crispy, 1 to 2 minutes. Using wire skimmer or
   slotted spoon, transfer jalapeno rings to paper towel-lined plate.
   After frying, reserve 2 tablespoons frying oil.
6. Heat reserved oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until
   shimmering. Add garlic, ginger, and remaining peppercorn mixture and
   cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture is fragrant and just
   beginning to brown, about 45 seconds. Add shrimp, scallions, and 1/2
   teaspoon salt and toss to coat. Line platter with lettuce. Transfer
   shrimp to platter, sprinkle with jalapeno rings, and serve
   immediately.

Coquilles St-Jacques
====================

Although coquilles St-Jacques simply means “scallops” in French, the
term is synonymous with the old French dish of scallops poached in white
wine, placed atop a puree of mushrooms in a scallop shell, covered with
a sauce made of the scallop poaching liquid, and gratineed under a
broiler.

Yield:  4 Servings

Ingredients
-----------

-  2 tbsp unsalted butter
-  1/2 cup diced shallots
-  8 oz button mushrooms, sliced
-  salt and pepper to taste
-  1 cup white wine (sauvignon blanc works well and is a good pairing)
-  1 pound sea scallops (about 12 scallops or 3 per person)
-  1/2 cup heavy cream
-  1 egg yolk
-  cayenne to taste
-  2 tsp minced tarragon
-  1 tsp lemon zest
-  1/4 cup grated Gruyere cheese

Directions
----------

1. Heat 2 tablespoons butter in small skillet over medium heat until
   foaming; add shallots and cook, stirring frequently, until
   translucent and a little bit golden. Add mushrooms and season with
   salt and pepper. Turn heat up to med-high and saute until they have
   released their liquid and are golden brown. Add Wine and bring to a
   simmer. Add Scallops to mixture and cook for 2 minutes per side.
   Remove Scallops and set aside.
2. Pour remaining mixture through a strainer to separate the liquids
   from the solids. And then return the liquid back to the pan along
   with any juices accumulated from the scallops. Bring mixture to a
   simmer over med-high heat. Add heavy cream and reduce by about half
   stirring frequently.
3. Once the sauce has reduced remove from heat and let cool for 1 minute
   exactly. Add egg yolk and whisk quickly(it is important that you
   whisk and shake the pan to do this quickly as you are not trying to
   cook the egg here.) Add the tarragon and lemon zest and a pinch of
   cayenne.
4. Divide out mushroom mixture between serving dishes (If you can get
   then Sea Scallop Shells work great. If not you can use a shallow
   gratin dish). Add an even amount of scallops to each dish. Spoon
   sauce evenly over the scallops. Top with Gruyere.
5. Broil on high, about 8-10 inches under the flame, until the scallops
   are hot, and the cheese is browned and bubbling. The edges will
   brulee or burn. This is not a problem, and actually how it’s supposed
   to look.

Make-a-head
-----------

You can make these ahead, and refrigerate until needed. To bring back to
temperature before you broil them, preheat oven to 350°F. and bake for
about 12-15 minutes , or until the centers are just warm. Switch oven to
broil, and broil on high as described.

Brioche Bread
=============

Yield: Yields 2 medium loaves or 1 large loaf.

Ingredients
-----------

The sponge
^^^^^^^^^^

- 1/3 cup whole milk, warm (100°F)
- 1 1/8 teaspoon active dry yeast
- 1 pinch sugar
- 1 1/4 cup bread flour, (unsifted)


The dough
^^^^^^^^^

- 6 oz butter, (unsalted) cold
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 1/4 teaspoon Salt
- 4 large egg
- 1 large egg, for egg wash

Directions
----------

#. For the sponge; pour the milk into a small bowl and sprinkle the yeast over it. Add the sugar and stir. Mix in 1/2 cup of flour until well blended. Scatter the remaining 3/4 cup flour over the top to cover the sponge. Let stand at room temp. until the mixture is spongy and doubles in volume, about 30- 35 minutes (the flour on top of the sponge will crack).
#. For the dough; remove the cold butter from the fridge. Place a strip of plastic wrap on a work surface, unwrap the butter and place on the plastic strip. Set the butter wrappings on top of the butter, and hit with a rolling pin to flatten and soften. Set nearby at room temp.
#. Pour the flour, sugar and salt into a 14 cup capacity food processor bowl, fitted with the steel blade. Pulse briefly to blend ingredients. Pour sponge over dry ingredients and pulse 3-5 times to incorporate yeast mixture. Put the eggs on top of dry ingredients and process for 15-20 seconds. Continue to process until most of the dough wraps around the blade. Remove the dough. Turn out the two onto a lightly floured work surface and gently knead until a smooth, cohesive dough forms, about 1 minute.
#. Put the dough into a large bowl, cover with plastic wrap. Cover bowl securely with another piece of plastic wrap. Let rise in a cool place until doubled in volume, about 2- 2 1/2 hours. Gently punch down and place in a clean bowl, place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the dough, cover bowl securely with plastic wrap, and refrigerate over night.
#. To form brioche loaves; lightly grease two pans and form into loaves.
#. Cover the pan with plastic wrap, and leave it at room temp. for 3 hours. Preheat the oven to 37°F. Beat the egg with a tsp. of water. Brush the top of the loaves. Bake for 35 minutes or until golden. Remove and cool on a wire rack.
