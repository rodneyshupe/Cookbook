Grilled Barbecued Chicken Kebabs
================================

Source: `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/6482-charcoal-grilled-barbecued-chicken-kebabs>`__

Ingredients
-----------

Sauce
^^^^^
- 1/2 cup ketchup
- 1/4 cup light or mild molasses
- 2 tablespoons grated onion (see note)
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 2 tablespoons cider vinegar
- 1 tablespoon light brown sugar

Kebabs
^^^^^^
- 2 pounds (900g) boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts, trimmed of excess
  fat and cut into 1-inch cubes (see note)
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 2 tablespoons sweet paprika
- 4 teaspoons sugar
- 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 2 slices bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 4 12-inch metal skewers

Directions
----------

1. *For the Sauce*: Bring all ingredients to simmer in small saucepan over
   medium heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce reaches ketchup-like
   consistency and is reduced to about 1 cup, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer
   1/2 cup sauce to small bowl and set aside remaining sauce to serve with
   cooked chicken.
2. *For the Kebabs*: Toss chicken and salt in large bowl; cover with plastic
   wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.
3. Light large chimney starter three-quarters filled with charcoal
   (4 1/2 quarts, about 75 briquettes) and allow to burn until coals are
   fully ignited and partially covered with thin layer of ash, about
   20 minutes. Arrange all coals in even layer over half of grill bottom,
   leaving other half empty. Position cooking grate over coals, cover grill,
   and heat grate until hot, about 5 minutes. Scrape grate clean with grill
   brush.
4. While grill heats, pat chicken dry with paper towels. Combine sweet
   paprika, sugar, and smoked paprika in small bowl. Process bacon in food
   processor until smooth paste forms, 30 to 45 seconds, scraping down bowl
   twice during processing. Add bacon paste and spice mixture to chicken;
   mix with hands or rubber spatula until ingredients are thoroughly blended
   and chicken is completely coated. Thread meat onto skewers, rolling or
   folding meat as necessary to maintain 1-inch cubes.
5. Place kebabs over coals and grill, turning one-quarter turn every
   2 to 2 1/2 minutes until well browned and slightly charred, 8 minutes for
   breasts or 10 minutes for thighs. (If flare-ups occur, slide kebabs to
   cool side of grill until fire dies down.) Brush top surface of kebabs
   with 1/4 cup sauce; flip and cook until sauce is brown in spots, about
   1 minute. Brush second side with remaining ¼ cup sauce; flip and continue
   to cook until brown in spots and instant-read thermometer inserted in
   center of meat registers 160 degrees for breasts and 175 degrees for
   thighs, about 1 minute longer. Remove kebabs from grill and let rest for
   5 minutes. Serve, passing reserved barbecue sauce separately.

Beer Can Chicken
================

Ingredients
-----------

-  3 to 5 pound (1.4 to 2.3kg) large whole chicken
-  3 tablespoons `Basic Barbecue Rub <#basic-barbecue-rub>`__
-  1 can beer, 12 ounces (354ml)

Directions
----------

1. Remove and discard the fat just inside the body cavities of the
   chicken. Remove the package of giblets, and set aside for another
   use. Rinse the chicken, inside and out, under cold running water,
   then drain and blot dry, inside and out, with paper towels. Sprinkle
   1 tablespoon of the rub inside the body and neck cavities, the rub
   another 1 tablespoon all over the skin of the bird. If you wish, rub
   another 1/2 tablespoon of the mixture between the flesh and the skin.
   Cover and refrigerate the chicken while you preheat the grill.
2. Set up the grill for indirect grilling placing a drip pan in the
   center. If using a charcoal grill, preheat it to medium. If using a
   gas grill, place all the wood chips in the smoker box and preheat the
   grill to high; then, when smoke appears, lower the heat to medium.
3. Pop the tab on the beer can. Using a “church key” style can opener,
   make 6 or 7 holes in the top of the can. Pour out the top inch of
   beer, then spoon the remaining dry rub through the holes into the
   beer. Holding the chicken upright, with the opening of the body
   cavity down, insert the beer can into the cavity.
4. When ready to cook, if using charcoal, toss half the wood chips on
   the coals. Oil the grill grate. Stand the chicken up in the center of
   the hot grate, over the drip pan. Spread out the legs to form a sort
   of tripod, to support the bird.
5. Cover the grill and cook the chicken until fall-off-the-bone tender,
   2 hours. If using charcoal, add 10 to 12°Fresh coals per side and the
   remaining wood chips after 1 hour.
6. Using tongs, lift the bird to a cutting board or platter, holding the
   metal spatula underneath the beer can for support. (Have the board or
   platter right next to the bird to make the move shorter. Be careful
   not to spill hot beer on yourself.) Let stand for 5 minutes before
   carving the meat off the upright carcass. (Toss the beer can out
   along with the carcass.)

Wet Rub Variation
-----------------

-  1/4 cup light-packed brown sugar
-  2 tablespoons dijon mustard (with white wine)
-  1 1/2 tablespoon Spanish smoked paprika
-  1/2 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
-  1/2 tablespoon kosher salt
-  1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together brown sugar, mustard, paprika,
   balsamic, salt, and pepper. Brush rub over chickens and massage to
   season every part of the bird (including under the skin).
2. Cook chicken at 350°F for 1 hour 15 min. Test internal temp in thigh,
   should be 165°F.

+----------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+-------------------+
| Prep Time: 5 minutes | Brine: 4-5 hours + overnight drying | Cooking Time: 45-60 minutes | Yield: 4 servings |
+----------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+-------------------+

Source: `Aussie BBQ Forum - Captain Cook <https://www.aussiebbq.info/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=65>`__

Ingredients
-----------
- 3 to 4 pound (1.4 to 1.8kg) Chicken
- 1/4 cup salt
- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon mustard powder
- 6 cups water
- olive oil
- lemon pepper
- herbs de provence

Directions
----------
1. Mix brine ingredients together in a glass bowl Place chicken in a Ziploc
   bag and pour in brine solution. Seal and place in the fridge for 4-5 hours.
2. Remove, rinse with fresh water, pat dry and stand upright over a dish or
   tray in the fridge overnight to let the skin dry.
3. `Spatchcock <https://www.marthastewart.com/1035187/how-spatchcock-chicken>`__
   (or butterfly) the chicken by removing the back bone and flatten.
4. Spread olive oil over chicken and then sprinkle liberally with lemon peppers
   and and herbs de provence.
5. Preheat the grill on high for 10 minutes. Roast the chicken indirectly on
   a roasting rack for about 15 minutes per pound until the internal meat
   temperature is 165°F.
6. Serve with fresh buttered rolls, salad and a bottle of bubbly.

Notes
-----
- The length of brining will determine the saltiness of the bird and how moist
  it will be, if you are going to smoke cook it, you could brine it for longer.
- You can adapt this for Turkey by doubling the quantity and brine the turkey
  for 8 hours instead of 4-5.
- A variation is to add fresh herbs or Chinese 5 spice to the brine.

Roast Chicken with Lemon and Garlic
===================================

+----------------------+--------------------------+-------------------+
| Prep Time: 5 minutes | Cooking Time: 45 minutes | Yield: 4 servings |
+----------------------+--------------------------+-------------------+

This recipe eliminates one of the most common complaints about whole roast
chickens—that it’s hard to know when they’re cooked all the way through. This
recipe makes it easy to check for doneness with lots of visual cues that anyone
can follow, but if you have an instant-read thermometer, go ahead and use it.
Remove chicken from the oven when thickest part of thigh hits 160°F, and
carryover cooking will bring it up to 165°F.

Ingredients
-----------
- 1 lemon
- 1 head of garlic
- 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter or extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 to 4 pound (1.4 to 1.8kg) whole chicken
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper

Directions
----------
1. Arrange a rack in center of oven; preheat to 425°F. Cut 1 lemon in half
   crosswise and remove any visible seeds. Cut 1 head of garlic in half
   crosswise. Melt ½ stick butter in a small saucepan or microwave in a small
   bowl.
2. Place whole chicken on a cutting board (best to use a plastic
   one you can sterilize) and pat dry with paper towels.  With chicken breast
   facing up and legs pointing toward you, use a sharp knife to slice through
   loose area of skin draped between leg and breast, making about a 3"-long
   incision. Continue cutting downward until you hit the joint that connects
   the thigh to the body, then stop (once you get through the skin, there’s
   not much there; if you are cutting through flesh, you’re too close to the
   breast). This exposes the leg joint, making it easy to tell if chicken is
   cooked. Repeat on second side.
3. Season every surface of chicken, including skin along backbone, inside
   cavity, under wings, and inside part of the leg you just exposed, with
   lots of salt and pepper. If you’re using kosher salt, it should take you
   4–5 generous pinches.
4. Transfer chicken breast side up to a large skillet. Arrange lemon and
   garlic cut sides down in skillet around chicken. Drizzle chicken all over
   with melted butter and transfer to oven.
5. Roast until chicken is nicely browned and cooked through, checking for
   doneness after 45 minutes. To check, carefully remove skillet from oven
   (the handle is hot!), poke a knife into leg joints, and pierce the meat.
   If juices run clear, chicken is done. If you see a rosy pink color, it
   needs more time. Continue to roast, checking every 5 minutes, until juices
   run clear. (If you’re not sure, you can also use the knife to lightly
   shred some of the meat along the thigh bone—the meat should look opaque
   and the fibers should separate easily.)
6. Let chicken rest in skillet at least 15 minutes before carving. Transfer
   chicken to a platter. Top with pan juices and serve with roasted lemon and
   garlic alongside.

===========================================================

+--------------------------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
| Prep Time: 15 minutes + 6 - 24 hours | Cooking Time: 1 hour | Yield: 3 - 4 servings |
+--------------------------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+

Source: `Food52.com <https://food52.com/recipes/75666-buttermilk-roast-chicken-with-potatoes-and-cornichon-butter>`__

Ingredients
-----------
- 1 whole chicken, about 4 pounds (1.8 kg)
- 1 cup buttermilk (substitute 1 1/2 teaspoons of cream of tartar and 1 cup regular milk)
- 1 cup pickle juice, from any type of pickles (dill, bread and butter, spicy garlic, etc.)
- 1 pinch kosher salt, to taste
- 1 1/2 pounds (680g) baby potatoes, halved, or small golden potatoes, peeled and sliced 1/4-inch thick (up to 2 pounds of potatoes)
- 1 splash olive oil
- 1 tablespoon butter, softened
- 4 cornichons, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped flat-leaf parsley

Directions
----------
1. Mix together buttermilk, pickle juice, and 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Place
   chicken in a gallon-sized plastic zipper-lock bag. Pour in the brine. Seal
   the bag, pressing out as much air as possible. Refrigerate 6 to 24 hours
   (a longer brine will result in a more flavorful bird).
2. About an hour before you roast the chicken, remove chicken from the bag and
   discard brine. Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Rub a little olive oil on
   the bottom of a large baking dish or ovenproof skillet (one large enough to
   hold the potatoes). Place the chicken in the middle of the dish,
   breast-side up, and let it come to room temperature.
3. Heat oven to 425° F.
4. Toss potatoes with 1 tablespoon olive oil and kosher salt, to taste.
   Arrange potatoes around the chicken. Evenly rub the chicken with 1/2 to
   1 tablespoon olive oil. Season the chicken and potatoes with freshly
   cracked black pepper.
5. Place the chicken and potatoes in the oven and roast for about
   50 to 70 minutes, rotating once, until the juices run clear or the thickest
   part of the thigh registers 165° F. (If the chicken is browning too quickly
   relative to its internal temperature, reduce the oven to 375° F to 400° F.)
6. Meanwhile, mash together the butter and cornichons with a fork. Don’t worry
   if they’re not completely integrated.
7. When the chicken is done, immediately remove it from the pan and rest on a
   cutting board for 10 to 15 minutes before carving. Add the cornichon butter
   and parsley to the hot potatoes. Once it starts to melt, toss to evenly
   integrate.

=====================================

+-----------------------+----------------------+--------------------------+-------------------+
| Prep Time: 15 minutes | Marinate: 6-24 hours | Cooking Time: 45 minutes | Yield: 4 servings |
+-----------------------+----------------------+--------------------------+-------------------+

Source: `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/9710-thai-grilled-cornish-hens-with-chili-dipping-sauce-gai-yang>`__

Ingredients
-----------

Hens
^^^^
- 4 Cornish game hens, 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds (570g to 680g) each, giblets discarded
- 1 cup fresh cilantro leaves and stems, chopped coarse
- 12 garlic cloves, peeled
- 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons ground white pepper
- 2 teaspoons ground coriander
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1/4 cup fish sauce

Dipping Sauce
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- 1/2 cup distilled white vinegar
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon minced Thai chiles
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions
----------
1. FOR THE HENS: Working with 1 hen at a time, place hens breast side down on
   cutting board and use kitchen shears to cut through bones on either side of
   backbones; discard backbones. Flip hens and press on breastbones to
   flatten. Trim any excess fat and skin.
2. Pulse cilantro leaves and stems, garlic, sugar, pepper, coriander, and salt
   in food processor until finely chopped, 10 to 15 pulses; transfer to small
   bowl. Add fish sauce and stir until marinade has consistency of loose paste.
3. Rub hens all over with marinade. Transfer hens and any excess marinade to
   1-gallon zipper-lock bag and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or up to
   24 hours, flipping bag halfway through marinating.
4. FOR THE DIPPING SAUCE: Bring vinegar to boil in small saucepan. Add sugar
   and stir to dissolve. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until vinegar
   mixture is slightly thickened, 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let vinegar
   mixture cool completely. Add chiles, garlic, and salt and stir until
   combined. Transfer sauce to airtight container and refrigerate until ready
   to use. (Sauce can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks. Bring to room
   temperature before serving.)
5. GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about
   15 minutes. Leave primary burner on high and turn off other burner(s).
   Adjust primary burner (or, if using three-burner grill, primary burner and
   second burner) as needed to maintain grill temperature between 400 and
   450°F.
6. Clean and oil cooking grate. Remove hens from bag, leaving any marinade
   that sticks to hens in place. Tuck wingtips behind backs and turn legs so
   drumsticks face inward toward breasts. Place hens, skin side up, on cooler
   side of grill (if using charcoal, arrange hens so that legs and thighs
   are facing coals). Cover and cook until skin is browned and breasts
   register 145 to 150°F, 30 to 35 minutes, rotating hens halfway
   through cooking.
7. Using tongs, carefully flip hens skin side down and move to hotter side of
   grill. Cover and cook until skin is crisp, deeply browned, and charred in
   spots and breasts register 160°F, 3 to 5 minutes, being careful to
   avoid burning.
8. Transfer hens, skin side up, to cutting board; tent with aluminum foil
   and let rest for 10 minutes. Slice each hen in half or into 4 pieces and
   serve, passing dipping sauce separately.

Directions
----------

1. In gallon-sized zipper-lock plastic bag, dissolve salt and sugar in 1
   quart water. Add chicken; press out as much air as possible from bag
   and seal; refrigerate until fully seasoned, 30 minutes. Remove from
   brine, rinse well under running water, dry thoroughly with paper
   towels, and season with pepper.
2. Turn all burners on grill to high, close lid, and heat grill until
   hot, 10 to 15 minutes. Adjust one burner to medium and grill chicken
   pieces over it, turning once, until color is light spotty brown, skin
   has thinned, and fat has rendered, 15 to 20 minutes. Using tongs,
   move chicken pieces over burner still set on high, turning constantly
   to prevent charring, until wings are dark spotty brown and skin has
   crisped, 5 to 7 minutes longer.
3. Combine butter and Tabasco sauce and toss with finished wings.

Variations
----------

For plain wings, serve with a squeeze of lemon or lime, or with an
accompanying dipping sauce, if desired. If you want BBQ style, in step
two brush with your favorite BBQ Sauce.

Dave’s BBQ Chicken Wings
========================

Ingredients
-----------

-  6 tablespoons table salt (or 12 tablespoons kosher salt)
-  6 tablespoons sugar
-  12 whole chicken wings
-  `Basic Barbecue Rub <#basic-barbecue-rub>`__
-  `Cajun Spice Mix <#louisiana-cajun-or-creole-seasoning-spice-mix>`__
-  Bacon Fat

Directions
----------

1. Dissolve sugar and salt in 4 cups of water in a one gallon-size zip
   lock freezer bag. Add chicken and press out as much air as possible
   from the bag and seal. Place in refrigerator for 30 minutes.
2. Remove chicken from brine and pat dry with paper towel. Apply equal
   amounts of Basic Barbecue Rub and Cajun Spice Mix or to taste, lay
   out in a cookie sheet with a wire rack so they are not overlapping
   and let sit in the fridge for at least 3-4 hours to dry.
3. When ready get the smoke going (or not) and put the wings on one side
   of the grill, that side on the lowest setting. The smoking side low
   to medium heat. Flip wings over after 15 minutes or more frequently
   if the heat is high, you are looking to get them smokey and dry.
   After about 30 minutes baste wings with melted bacon fat, flip and
   baste again you can do this a couple of times if you like. There
   should be no flare ups or little on the wing side but the low heat is
   to apply extra cooking/drying and prevents the worst of the fat build
   up.
4. Keep smoking and cooking until the skin is getting crispy. It should
   be greyish from the spices and smoke. At this point you can raise the
   heat and switch them to the smoking side to crisp up more, if you do
   it on the wings side get ready for lots of flames. When done to your
   liking take them off and pour on as much room temperature BBQ sauce
   as you like, we coated about half of each wing drizzling with a table
   spoon. Overall don’t cook them too long, 40-50 minutes total time
   from when they went on the grill.

Variation
---------

Alternate brine: Substitute sugar with 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce.

Chicken and Sausage Gumbo
=========================

Source: `Cook’s
Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/9384-chicken-and-sausage-gumbo#>`__

Ingredients
-----------

-  1 cup (5 ounces or 145g) all-purpose flour
-  1 tablespoon vegetable oil
-  1 onion, chopped fine
-  1 green bell pepper, chopped fine
-  2 celery ribs, chopped fine
-  1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme
-  3 garlic cloves, minced
-  1 teaspoon paprika
-  2 bay leaves
-  1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
-  Salt and pepper
-  4 cups chicken broth, room temperature
-  2 pounds (900g) boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed
-  8 ounces (225g) andouille sausage, halved and sliced 1/4 inch thick
-  6 scallions, sliced thin
-  1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar
-  Hot sauce

Directions
----------

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425°F.
   Place flour in 12-inch skillet and bake, stirring occasionally, until
   color of ground cinnamon, 40 to 55 minutes. (As flour approaches
   desired color, it will take on very nutty aroma that will smell
   faintly of burnt popcorn, and it will need to be stirred more
   frequently.) Transfer flour to medium bowl and let cool. (Toasted
   flour can be stored in airtight container in cool, dark place for up
   to 6 months.)
2. Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion,
   bell pepper, and celery and cook, stirring frequently, until
   softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in thyme, garlic, paprika, bay leaves,
   cayenne, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and cook until
   fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in 2 cups broth. Add chicken in single
   layer (chicken will not be completely submerged in liquid) and bring
   to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken
   is fork-tender, 15 to 17 minutes. Transfer chicken to plate.
3. Slowly whisk remaining 2 cups broth in small increments into toasted
   flour until thick, smooth, batter-like paste forms. Increase heat to
   medium and slowly whisk paste into gumbo, making sure each addition
   is incorporated before adding next. Stir in andouille. Simmer,
   uncovered, until gumbo thickens slightly, 20 to 25 minutes.
4. Once cool enough to handle, shred chicken into bite-size pieces. Stir
   chicken and scallions into gumbo. Remove pot from heat, stir in
   vinegar, and season with salt to taste. Discard bay leaves. Serve,
   passing hot sauce separately. (Gumbo can be refrigerated in airtight
   container for up to 3 days.)

Pesto Chicken Garlic Knot Sliders
=================================

Source: `Tasty <https://tasty.co/recipe/pesto-chicken-garlic-knot-sliders>`__

Ingredients
-----------
- 1 1/2 pounds (680g) pizza dough
- 3 cups rotisserie chicken, shredded
- 8 ounces (237ml) pesto, 1 jar
- 2 cups (200g) shredded mozzarella cheese
- 3 tablespoons salted butter
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped

Directions
----------

1. Cut pizza dough into eighths. (Each ball of dough should yield 8 even-sized
   pieces of dough, for a total of 16).
2. Using your hands, roll each piece of dough into a thin strip about
   7 inches (18cm) long. Then carefully tie them into a knot, tucking the
   loose ends of dough underneath.
3. Place each tied knot on a baking sheet or casserole dish with high sides,
   nestling them close together in a 4x4 in (10x10-cm) grid. Once all the
   knots are placed in the dish, cover and let rest for 10 minutes.
4. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
5. Uncover and bake for 12 minutes or until the slider buns are golden brown
   and no doughy grey bits remain.
6. Once the knots are out of the oven, lower the oven temperature to 350°F.
7. Allow the knots to cool, carefully remove them from the baking dish and
   cut the grid horizontally, creating both a top and bottom piece.
   NOTE: It’s helpful to hold the knots together with a towel on top while
   cutting them horizontally, as the motion of the knife might cause some of
   them to pull apart.
8. Return the bottom half of the knot-grid to the original baking dish. Evenly
   layer the bread with cooked chicken, followed by the pesto and mozzarella
   cheese. Place the top half of the garlic knots on top.
9. Mix together melted butter, garlic, and parsley. Brush mixture liberally
   over the top of the knots.
10. Bake at 350°F (180°C) for an additional 10 minutes until the tops of the
    knots are golden brown and cheese is melted.
11. Pull apart for individual sliders.

2. Whisk ketchup, soy sauce, Worcestershire, sugar, garlic, anchovies,
   and vinegar together in second bowl. Stir 2 tablespoons sauce into
   chicken in a medium bowl and set aside remaining sauce.
3. Bring 4 quarts water to boil in large pot. Add noodles and cook,
   stirring often, until almost tender (center should still be firm with
   slightly opaque dot), 3 to 10 minutes (cooking times will vary
   depending on whether you are using fresh or dry noodles). Drain
   noodles and rinse under cold running water until water runs clear.
   Drain well and set aside.
4. Heat 1/2 teaspoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat
   until just smoking. Add mushrooms and carrot and cook, stirring

5. Return skillet to high heat, add 1/2 teaspoon oil, and heat until
   beginning to smoke. Add cabbage and scallions and cook, without
   stirring, for 30 seconds. Cook, stirring occasionally, until cabbage
   and scallions are spotty brown and crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes.
   Transfer to bowl with mushrooms and carrot.
6. Stir the marinated chicken into the sesame oil-cornstarch mixture
   until uniformly combined. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a 12-inch nonstick
   skillet over high heat until smoking; add half of the chicken to the
   skillet in a flat, even layer. Cook, without stirring, but gently
   separating the pieces, until golden brown on the first side, about 1
   minute; turn the chicken pieces and cook until lightly browned on the
   second side, about 30 seconds. Transfer the chicken to a clean bowl.
   Repeat with an additional 2 teaspoons oil and the remaining chicken;
   cover to keep warm.
7. Return skillet to high heat; add reserved sauce, remaining 1/2 cup
   broth, and noodles. Cook, scraping up any browned bits, until noodles
   are warmed through, about 1 minute. Transfer noodles to bowl with
   vegetables and chicken and toss to combine. Season with salt to
   taste, and serve immediately.

Old-Fashioned Stuffed Turkey
============================

Ingredients
-----------

Turkey
^^^^^^

-  1 turkey, 12 to 15 pounds (5.4 to 6.8kg), giblets and neck reserved for gravy, if making
-  3 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons kosher salt
-  2 teaspoons baking powder
-  12 ounces (340g) salt pork, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices and rinsed

Stuffing
^^^^^^^^

-  1 1/2 pounds (680g) white sandwich bread (about 15 slices), cut into
   1/2-inch cubes (about 12 cups)
-  4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus extra for baking dish
-  1 medium onion, chopped fine (about 1 cup)
-  2 celery ribs, chopped fine (about 1 cup)
-  Kosher salt and ground black pepper
-  2 tablespoons minced fresh thyme leaves
-  1 tablespoon minced fresh marjoram leaves
-  1 tablespoon minced fresh sage leaves
-  1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
-  1 36-inch square cheesecloth, folded in quarters
-  2 large eggs

Directions
----------

1. FOR THe TURKeY: Using fingers or handle of wooden spoon, separate
   turkey skin from meat on breast, legs, thighs, and back; avoid
   breaking skin. Rub 1 tablespoon salt evenly inside cavity of turkey,
   1 1/2 teaspoons salt under skin of each breast, and 1 1/2 teaspoons
   salt under skin of each leg. Wrap turkey tightly with plastic wrap;
   refrigerate 24 to 48 hours.
2. FOR THe STUFFING: Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven
   to 250°F. Spread bread cubes in single layer on baking sheet; bake
   until edges have dried but centers are slightly moist (cubes should
   yield to pressure), about 45 minutes, stirring several times during
   baking. Transfer to large bowl and increase oven temperature to
   325°F.
3. While bread dries, heat 4 tablespoons butter in 12-inch skillet over
   medium-high heat; when foaming subsides, add onion, celery, 2
   teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper; cook, stirring occasionally,
   until vegetables begin to soften and brown slightly, 7 to 10 minutes.
   Stir in herbs; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add vegetables to
   bowl with dried bread; add 1 cup broth and toss until evenly
   moistened.

4. TO ROAST THe TURKeY: Combine remaining 2 teaspoons kosher salt and
   baking powder in small bowl. Remove turkey from refrigerator and
   unwrap. Thoroughly dry inside and out with paper towels. Using
   skewer, poke 15 to 20 holes in fat deposits on top of breast halves
   and thighs, 4 to 5 holes in each deposit. Sprinkle surface of turkey
   with salt-baking powder mixture and rub in mixture with hands,
   coating skin evenly. Tuck wings underneath turkey. Line turkey cavity
   with cheesecloth, pack with 4 to 5 cups stuffing, tie ends of
   cheesecloth together. Cover remaining stuffing with plastic wrap and
   refrigerate. Using twine, loosely tie turkey legs together. Place
   turkey breast-side down in V-rack set in roasting pan and drape salt
   pork slices over back.
5. Roast turkey breast-side down until thickest part of breast registers
   130°F on instant-read thermometer, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Remove roasting
   pan from oven (close oven door) and increase oven temperature to
   450°F. Transfer turkey in V-rack to rimmed baking sheet. Remove and
   discard salt pork. Using clean potholders or kitchen towels, rotate
   turkey breast-side up. Cut twine binding legs and remove stuffing
   bag; empty into reserved stuffing in bowl. Pour drippings from
   roasting pan into fat separator and reserve for gravy, if making.
6. Once oven has come to temperature, return turkey in V-rack to
   roasting pan and roast until skin is golden brown and crisp, thickest
   part of breast registers 160°F, and thickest part of thigh registers
   175°F, about 45 minutes, rotating pan halfway through. Transfer
   turkey to carving board and let rest, uncovered, 30 minutes.
7. While turkey rests, reduce oven temperature to 400°F. Whisk eggs and
   remaining 1/2 cup broth together in small bowl. Pour egg mixture over
   stuffing and toss to combine, breaking up any large chunks; spread in
   buttered 13- by 9-inch baking dish. Bake until stuffing registers
   165°F and top is golden brown, about 15 minutes. Carve turkey and
   serve with stuffing and `Turkey Gravy <#turkey-gravy>`__.
