Best Lemon Bars
===============

Source: `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/10616-best-lemon-bars>`__

Ingredients
-----------

Crust
^^^^^
- 1 cup (5 ounces) all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

Filling
^^^^^^^
- 1 cup (7 ounces) granulated sugar
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons cream of tartar
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 3 large eggs plus 3 large yolks
- 2 teaspoons grated lemon zest plus 2/3 cup juice (4 lemons)
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces
- Confectioners' sugar (optional)

Directions
----------
1. FOR THE CRUST: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to
   350 degrees. Make foil sling for 8-inch square baking pan by folding
   2 long sheets of aluminum foil so each is 8 inches wide. Lay sheets of
   foil in pan perpendicular to each other, with extra foil hanging over
   edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing
   foil flush to pan.
2. Whisk flour, sugar, and salt together in bowl. Add melted butter and
   stir until combined. Transfer mixture to prepared pan and press into
   even layer over entire bottom of pan (do not wash bowl). Bake crust
   until dark golden brown, 19 to 24 minutes, rotating pan halfway
   through baking.
3. FOR THE FILLING: While crust bakes, whisk sugar, flour, cream of tartar,
   and salt together in now-empty bowl. Whisk in eggs and yolks until no
   streaks of egg remain. Whisk in lemon zest and juice. Transfer mixture
   to saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until
   mixture thickens and registers 160 degrees, 5 to 8 minutes. Off heat,
   stir in butter. Strain filling through fine-mesh strainer set over bowl.
4. Pour filling over hot crust and tilt pan to spread evenly. Bake until
   filling is set and barely jiggles when pan is shaken, 8 to 12 minutes.
   (Filling around perimeter of pan may be slightly raised.) Let bars cool
   completely, at least 1½ hours. Using foil overhang, lift bars out of pan
   and transfer to cutting board. Cut into bars, wiping knife clean between
   cuts as necessary. Before serving, dust bars with confectioners' sugar,
   if using.

Pecan Bars
==========

Source: `Cooks Illustrated <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/8571-ultranutty-pecan-bars?incode=MCSCD00L0>`__

Ingredients
-----------

Crust
^^^^^

-  1 3/4 cups (8 3/4 ounces) all-purpose flour
-  6 tablespoons (2 2/3 ounces) sugar
-  1/2 teaspoon salt
-  8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

Topping
^^^^^^^

-  3/4 cup packed (5 1/4 ounces) light brown sugar
-  1/2 cup light corn syrup
-  7 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and hot
-  1 teaspoon vanilla extract
-  1/2 teaspoon salt
-  4 cups (1 pound) pecan halves, toasted
-  1/2 teaspoon flake sea salt (optional)

Directions
----------

1. FOR THe CRUST: Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to
   350°F. Make foil sling for 13 by 9-inch baking pan by folding 2 long
   sheets of aluminum foil; first sheet should be 13 inches wide and
   second sheet should be 9 inches wide. Lay sheets of foil in pan
   perpendicular to each other, with extra foil hanging over edges of
   pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush
   to pan. Lightly spray foil with vegetable oil spray.
2. Whisk flour, sugar, and salt together in medium bowl. Add melted
   butter and stir with wooden spoon until dough begins to form. Using
   your hands, continue to combine until no dry flour remains and small
   portion of dough holds together when squeezed in palm of your hand.
   evenly scatter tablespoon-size pieces of dough over surface of pan.
   Using your fingertips and palm of your hand, press and smooth dough
   into even thickness in bottom of pan.
3. FOR THe TOPPING: Whisk sugar, corn syrup, melted butter, vanilla, and
   salt together in medium bowl until smooth (mixture will look
   separated at first but will become homogeneous), about 20 seconds.
   Fold pecans into sugar mixture until nuts are evenly coated.
4. Pour topping over crust. Using spatula, spread topping over crust,
   pushing to edges and into corners (there will be bare patches). Bake
   until topping is evenly distributed and rapidly bubbling across
   entire surface, 23 to 25 minutes.
5. Transfer pan to wire rack and lightly sprinkle with flake sea salt,
   if using. Let bars cool completely in pan on rack, about 1 1/2 hours.
   Using foil overhang, lift bars out of pan and transfer to cutting
   board. Cut into 24 bars. (Bars can be stored at room temperature for
   up to 5 days.)

Notes
-----

*It is important to use pecan halves, not pieces. The edges of the bars
will be slightly firmer than the center. If desired, trim 1/4 inch from
the edges before cutting into bars. Toast the pecans on a rimmed baking
sheet in a 350°F oven until fragrant, 8 to 12 minutes, shaking the sheet
halfway through.*
